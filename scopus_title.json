    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of the Modruvallabok Project is a description of the language in Modruvallabok. Publication of a survey of the orthography and morphology is planned for the not too distant future. It was deemed, however, to be in the interest of Old Icelandic research that the concordance and index should be made available to the public as soon as possible. As an index or concordance to an -practically -unavailable text is an absurdity, it was decided to include the transcription of the text as well. Of course, the publication will come into its own only when more texts have been treated in the same way and comparison, both synchronic and diachronic, has become possible. It is hoped, however, that the study of Old Icelandic will already now profit from this work. Users are kindly requested to forward details to the publisher of any errors they may discover in the text and index. © 1987 by E. J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands. All rights reserved."
