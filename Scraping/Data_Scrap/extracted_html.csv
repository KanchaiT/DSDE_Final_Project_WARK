1.html,"Mödruvallabók, AM 132 Fol.: Volume One: Index and Concordance","The ultimate goal of the Modruvallabok Project is a description of the language in Modruvallabok. Publication of a survey of the orthography and morphology is planned for the not too distant future. It was deemed, however, to be in the interest of Old Icelandic research that the concordance and index should be made available to the public as soon as possible. As an index or concordance to an -practically -unavailable text is an absurdity, it was decided to include the transcription of the text as well. Of course, the publication will come into its own only when more texts have been treated in the same way and comparison, both synchronic and diachronic, has become possible. It is hoped, however, that the study of Old Icelandic will already now profit from this work. Users are kindly requested to forward details to the publisher of any errors they may discover in the text and index. © 1987 by E. J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands.

In order to solve the issues such as the cross, duplication, contradictions and out-of-scope preparation among compulsory standards, the mandatory standards in the field of soil and water conservation field were studied and analyzed in accordance with the requirements of national mandatory standards must be integrated and briefed. Methods On the basis of comprehensively collecting and sorting the compulsory standards in the field of soil and water conservation, we classified and gathered 5 aspects of data, including security, of which covers facilities security, flood protection security, construction security and property security, soil erosion protection, environmental protection, acceptance of management and protection, design requirements; besides, we studied and analyzed item by item according to the factors such as necessity, purpose, core content, and applicable scope of a formulated standard by classification and summarizing. [Results] In all 186 Paragraphs of 71 Articles of the mandatory standards, the 74 Paragraphs from 19 Articles were proposed to be remained, 35 Paragraphs from 24 Articles that complied with mandatory standards but can be integrated into other standards were proposed to be integrated; 10 Paragraphs from 7 Articles that were fully covered by other mandatory standards or not applicable to be standardized in the form of standards were proposed to be abolished; 67 Paragraphs from 22 Articles that were not targeted to “ Health, Security, Environmentfriendly, Social Economy Management” were proposed to be transformed. [Conclusions] We proposed to integrate standards related to out-of-scope professional and industries; defined the scope in strict accordance with the national mandatory standards to avoid excessive mandatory scope; added verifiable, confirmable and detectable mandatory standards; put forward suggestions for the improvement on the mandatory standards in the field of soil and water conservation, for instance, comprehensive control of soil erosion; built the frameworks for perfecting mandatory standards in the field of soil and water conservation, so as to provide references for integrating, briefing, and perfecting of the compulsory standards above. © 2017, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.
