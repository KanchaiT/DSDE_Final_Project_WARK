# Paper Topic Classification Project

This project aims to classify research papers into predefined topics or research domains using machine learning techniques. By processing metadata like titles, abstracts, and keywords from JSON files, the project builds an end-to-end pipeline for efficient analysis and visualization of research trends.

## Key Objectives

1. **Feature Extraction**:

   - Extract relevant metadata such as titles, abstracts, keywords, and subject areas from JSON files.
   - Preprocess and clean the data to prepare it for machine learning.

2. **Dataset Preparation**:

   - Combine and organize extracted data into a structured dataset.
   - Label the dataset with research domains for supervised learning.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:

   - Train a classification model using features like TF-IDF and algorithms such as Random Forest or Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to display insights such as topic distributions or keyword trends.

## Deliverables

- **Machine Learning Model**: A functional model for classifying research papers.
- **Data Pipeline**: A pipeline for ingesting, processing, and analyzing metadata.
- **Visualizations**: Clear and insightful representations of research trends.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations of the approach and results.

This project highlights the practical application of data science techniques to real-world metadata, providing actionable insights into research paper classification and trends.
