1.html,"Mödruvallabók, AM 132 Fol.: Volume One: Index and Concordance","The ultimate goal of the Modruvallabok Project is a description of the language in Modruvallabok. Publication of a survey of the orthography and morphology is planned for the not too distant future. It was deemed, however, to be in the interest of Old Icelandic research that the concordance and index should be made available to the public as soon as possible. As an index or concordance to an -practically -unavailable text is an absurdity, it was decided to include the transcription of the text as well. Of course, the publication will come into its own only when more texts have been treated in the same way and comparison, both synchronic and diachronic, has become possible. It is hoped, however, that the study of Old Icelandic will already now profit from this work. Users are kindly requested to forward details to the publisher of any errors they may discover in the text and index. © 1987 by E. J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands.

100.html,PAHs in polystyrene food contact materials: An unintended consequence,"Eight low-ring PAHs were detected in 21 polystyrene (PS) food contact materials (FCMs) samples while high-ring PAHs (> 4 rings) were not found. This is because the reaction pathway for formation of high-ring PAHs consists of more steps than it does for low-high PAHs. The concentrations of Σ8PAH were from 18.9 ± 5.16 ng/g for product colorless fruit fork to 476 ± 52.0 ng/g for foam instant noodle container. These data were far beyond levels of PAHs in other plastics. Of the eight PAHs detected, Phe had the highest average concentration, followed by Nap. These two PAHs collectively accounted for over 80% of the Σ8PAH concentrations in all PS FCMs. Levels of Σ8PAH in expanded PS FCMs were higher than those in extruded ones due to utilization of foaming agent. The concentrations of Σ8PAH were lower in colorless PS FCMs than in colored ones. Auxochromes and chromophores contributed to the change of short-chain hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbon. Simulated migration values of PAHs from PS FCMs to food varied widely. The migration value of Σ8PAH with maximum probability was below 10 ng/g, which the maximum tolerated migration level for substance according to the European Union standards. However, higher migration values were possible and the potential health risk should still be concerned because the simulated migration displayed a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, water was used as food simulant would always lead to an underestimate of PAHs migration to real daily food, and then lead to an underestimate of risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Si-Qi; Ni Hong-Gang; Zeng Hui,Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Circular Economy\Shenzhen Graduate School\China,-,Food contact material; Migration; PAH; Polystyrene; Potential health risk
1000.html,"Techniques in international law-making: Extrapolation, analogy, form and the emergence of an international law of disaster relief","This article traces the emergence of an international law of disaster relief from a patchwork of norms through to a holistic body of international law. It argues that, for many years, the international law of disaster relief existed in piecemeal fashion. Since there is no overarching treaty on the subject at the global level, a hodgepodge of instruments have been concluded, namely subject-specific and disaster-specific treaties at the global level, regional and sub-regional agreements, bilateral agreements as well as soft law. However, through the work of the International Law Commission and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, a holistic body of international law relating to disaster relief is in the process of emerging. This article argues that this holistic body is emerging primarily as a result of three techniques that, while unconventional, are used relatively frequently in the making of international law. The three techniques are: (i) extrapolation from a series of piecemeal instruments to form a generalized standard; (ii) the use of analogy and (iii) the conclusion of instruments that are soft in form but contain a mixture of hard law and soft law. The way in which the techniques have been used to develop a body of international law relating to disaster relief is analysed, their use in other fields of international law discussed and limitations on their use in the disaster law context identified. © The Author(s), 2018.

1001.html,The responsibility to protect beyond borders in the Law of Nature and Nations,"While histories of human rights have proliferated in recent decades, little attention has been given to the history of thinking about duties to protect these rights beyond sovereign borders. We have a good understanding of the history of duties of sovereign states to ensure the safety and well-being of their own citizens and of the right of other states to forcefully intervene when these duties are violated. But the story of the development of thinking about duties to assist and protect the vulnerable beyond borders remains to be told. This article defends the importance of excavating and examining past thinking about these duties. It then sketches key aspects of Western natural law thinking about such duties, from Francisco de Vitoria through to Immanuel Kant, claiming that such study holds the promise of exposing from where ideas that prevail in international law and politics have come and retrieving alternative ideas that have been long forgotten but that may reward renewed consideration. It concludes by briefly outlining how three such retrieved ideas might be of particular use for those seeking to push international law and politics in a more just direction today. © The Author(s), 2018.

1003.html,Winners and losers of the plurality of international courts and tribunals: Afterword to Laurence boisson de Chazournes' foreword,"By asking about 'winners and losers', this reply questions the preference of states for a plurality of international courts and tribunals, challenges the coherence of the international legal order as a dominant rationale for judicial actors to coordinate, and raises doubts about their overall success in managing plurality. It argues that their coordinating efforts have to be understood as reactive rather than proactive steps in a complex decision-making environment in which litigants, their lawyers, and domestic courts play a significant but underappreciated role. While it is true that some coordination between judicial actors exists, it remains to be seen whether the 'threads of a managerial approach' amount to more than thin, singular, and often random strings that will develop into dense, resilient, and predictable webs of international jurisprudence. © The Author(s), 2018.

1004.html,"The curious case of Singapore's BIA desertion trials: War crimes, projects of empire and the rule of law","This article critically analyses a set of war crimes trials, conducted by the British colonial authorities in post-World War II Singapore, which dealt, among others, with the contentious issue of deserting British Indian Army soldiers. While seemingly obscure, these trials illuminate important lessons about rule of law dynamics in war crimes trials. Although these trials were intended by their organizers to facilitate the return of British colonial rule, they resulted in unexpected acquittals and conviction non-confirmations. On the one hand, by applying British military law as a back-up source of law when prosecuting 'violations of the laws and usages of war', the British contravened the rule of law by retrospectively subjecting the Japanese defence to unfamiliar legal standards. On the other hand, by binding themselves to a pre-existing and relatively clear source of law, the British were constrained by the rule of law even as this empowered the Japanese defence. These findings speak to broader debates on the challenges of developing international criminal law, by provocatively suggesting that, from a rule of law perspective, what is most important in a body of law is its clarity, accessibility and comprehensiveness rather than its source or its purported 'universality'. © The Author(s), 2018.

1005.html,Does exposure to preparatory work affect treaty interpretation? An experimental study on international law students and experts,"Ample research has demonstrated that exposure to inadmissible evidence affects decision making in criminal and civil cases. However, the difficulty of ignoring information in the context of legal interpretation has not been examined yet. Our study addresses the possible effects that exposure to preparatory work has on the interpretation of treaties. In the present article, we examine the ability of students enrolled in international law courses and of international law experts to ignore preparatory work when they are not allowed to use it. We found that exposure to preparatory work affected the students' interpretation of treaties, while no such effect was found among the experts. These results reaffirm the practical relevance of the debate over the hierarchy between the rules of treaty interpretation. In particular, our study demonstrates that preparatory work can play a significant role in decision making, depending on the legal rule that applies to the use of such materials. More generally, our study suggests that legal interpretation by students and experts is qualitatively different and that international law experts might be better able than non-experts to discount irrelevant information in the process of treaty interpretation. © The Author(s), 2018.

1007.html,Self/Image: Reading the Visual in Atwood's Fictive Autobiographies,"Margaret Atwood's extensive back catalogue includes a group of fictive autobiographies, each engaged in a self-reflexive consideration of the problems involved in writing a life story. These fictive meta-autobiographies consciously critique any act of self-representation within narrative in a radical challenge to phallogocentric models of life-writing and truth-telling. This group of texts (including Cat's Eye [1988], Lady Oracle [1976], The Handmaid's Tale [1985], and The Blind Assassin [2000], as well as some of Atwood's poetry) also incorporates a dominant use of visual images, particularly photographs: each extending questions involving the ""real,"" the ""copy,"" origination, attribution, and authority. These questions open up new ways of considering how text and image conspire to defer certainty in the objective and subjective ""real,"" as Atwood's visual texts prove to be as duplicitous as the language through which they are narrated. This article connects with critical accounts of life-writing and with Susan Sontag's reflections on photography in order to discuss the status of the visual image as an agent of representation within any autobiographical account. © The Author(s) 2017.

1008.html,How Far Would You Go? Trajectories of Revenge in Margaret Atwood's Short Fiction,"In many of Margaret Atwood's stories, neither love nor money makes the world or, rather, the plot go round. The prime interest and profit for her offended protagonists often derives from a satisfactorily accomplished revenge. The ancient law of talion, of an-eye-for-an-eye, presides over these stories. This paper explores the two main responses to injury and aggression that correspond to the chronological trajectory of Atwood's writings. In her early short fiction, retaliatory drives are typically directed inward. The (mainly female) victims tend to punish themselves rather than their aggressors. In the later fiction, by contrast, outer-directed reprisal becomes the reactive rule. As selected instances will show, Atwood's human and nonhuman avengers, including nature itself, increasingly find varied ways to strike back at offenders. © The Author(s) 2018.

1010.html,Margaret Atwood's Reception in Canada and the United States: A Comparative Analysis of North American Reviews of the Blind Assassin,"Based on a large corpus of reviews from Canada and the USA and taking into account my recent large-scale study of the reception of Margaret Atwood's earlier novels in both North American countries, this article investigates how the reviewer's nationality and that of the review's target audience factor into the reception of a writer's works. This is exemplarily documented in a case study of Atwood's novel The Blind Assassin (2000), published at the end of her middle creative period. What do the reviews focus on and are there any striking differences attributable to the national and cultural context the review was written in and for? Was the evaluative response to the novel in the two North American countries similar or did it deviate significantly? © The Author(s) 2017.

1012.html,"MaddAddam, Biocapitalism, and Affective Things","This essay considers the ethical dimensions of Atwood's recent speculative fiction, the MaddAddam trilogy (2003-14), alongside a framework that Nikolas Rose, Sunder Rajan, and others term as biocapitalism. The trilogy imagines the social, cultural, affective, and ecological implications of the convergence of capitalism and biotechnology. In the MaddAddam trilogy, the fantasy of human independence and invulnerability central to neoliberalism and biocapitalism is depicted at its devastating endgame, in which the unbridled commodification of life has resulted in its near annihilation. Atwood's novels suggest that we ignore interdependence, affectivity, and responsibility to our peril, evoking a posthumanist perspective in the dramatization of a catastrophic anthropocentrism that regards organic matter - the world's flora and fauna, the human body's cellular data - as marketable, utilitarian objects. © The Author(s) 2017.

1016.html,Developing a strategy of environmental management for electric generating companies using DEA-methodology,"This paper investigates the possibility of utilization of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric method of optimization, to solving problems of environmental management in electric generating companies. An advantage of DEA is the possibility to work with DMUs without any knowledge of the actual functional relation between inputs and outputs. We analyze methods of incorporating the negative ecologic effects into a model and propose an algorithm for applying the basic DEA CCR input-oriented model twice in succession for the purpose of developing an optimal (ecologically and economically) strategy for environmental management in electricity energy generating companies. The developed method consists of sequentially solving several DEA models: the first-stage model determines the effectiveness of DMUs from an ecologic perspective and calculates target values for decreasing negative ecologic effects of non-effective DMUs. The second stage requires solving one input-oriented CCR model for each non-effective object, using economic and social characteristics of projects meant to reduce negative environmental influence, and using the target values calculated in the first stage as outputs. Besides the problem of evaluation the comparative efficiency of DMUs, ecologically oriented studies also often needs to evaluate the changes in a DMU’s efficiency dynamically. For this, the Malmquist productivity index (MPI) is used. MPI is a non-parametric method for analyzing time series that allows to track changes in DMU efficiency over time by means of DEA models. We test this algorithm on the statistical data provided by Russian electric companies for the period 2009-2011, and discuss methods for its practical application. The statistical data used in our calculations is averaged, and the results do not reflect the entire picture and should not be used to judge the quality of ecologic management in these companies. Nevertheless, the calculations can be used to evaluate the progress of completion and the practicality of investment projects of companies, from an environmental viewpoint. They also may be used to help develop state programs for support of modernization in electric energy industry, ecologic standards or energy-saving programs. © 2017 ASSA.",Ratner Svetlana; Ratner Pavel,V.A.

1017.html,Long-Term Underwater Hydrophobicity: Exploring Topographic and Chemical Requirements,"A family of hybrid organoinorganic silica-based particles with varied chemical natures and morphologies has been synthesized to test their ability to develop coatings with underwater hydrophobicity. The particles were characterized by elemental microanalysis, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering to evaluate the organic content, observe the morphology, and estimate the aggregate size, respectively. These morphologies were transferred into surface topographies by spraycoating dispersions made from the particles onto glass supports, resulting in coatings with an ample range of profiles and roughness but all of them being superhydrophobic. Atomic force microscopy and optical profilometry were used to map the coating surfaces and analyze the topography. Then, underwater hydrophobicity endurance was tested by immersion under a 2 cm 20 °C water column perpendicular to circular glass supports coated with the particles. The so-called mirror effect derived from the occurrence of the primary plastron (continuous air layer occluded between the surface and the water) was observed on the surface of all of the coatings tested. Apart from the dependency of plastrons on the water temperature and substrate shape, the plastron quality and lifetime is notably different depending on the particle morphology and thus on the coating topography. These experiments have demonstrated that the most persistent mirror effects, and therefore underwater superhydrophobicity, were produced on coatings that exhibited the smoothest topographies at the micrometric scale. In addition, these particle-only coatings can be made mechanically stable and robust by blending with a polymer matrix. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Martínez-Gómez Aránzazu; López Silvia; García Teresa; De Francisco Raquel; Tiemblo Pilar; García Nuria,Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología de Polímeros\ICTP-CSIC\Spain,-,-
1018.html,Preparation of Gold Nanocomposites with Tunable Charge and Hydrophobicity via the Application of Polymer/Surfactant Complexation,"During the synthesis of gold nanoparticle (NP) assemblies, the interfacial charge and hydrophobicity of the primary particles play a distinguished role. In the present article, we demonstrate that the association of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) capped gold NPs with sodium alkyl sulfates provide a powerful route for the manipulation of these interfacial properties. Dynamic light-scattering, electrophoretic mobility, UV-vis-near-infrared spectroscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy measurements were used to characterize the PEI/surfactant/gold nanoassemblies. The results indicate the formation of gold NPs surrounded by a PEI/surfactant shell with composition-dependent charge and hydrophobicity. The mean size and the aggregation of the nanoassemblies can be fine tuned by the amount of surfactant bound to the primary gold NPs as well as by the application of controlled mixing methods. The specific features of the prepared nanocomposites may be further exploited in next-generation applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Bali Krisztina; Sáfrán György; Pécz Béla; Mészáros Róbert,Laboratory of Interfaces and Nanosized Systems\Institute of Chemistry\Hungary; Research Institute for Technical Physics and Materials Sciences (RITP)\Centre for Energy Research\Hungary; Department of Chemistry\University J.

1019.html,Synthesis of core–shell structured FAU/SBA-15 composite molecular sieves and their performance in catalytic cracking of polystyrene,"Composite molecular sieves, FAU/SBA-15, having core-shell structure were synthesized. The synthesized composite sieves were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), pyrolysis fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption spectra (NH3-TPD), UV Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques. XRD, SEM, TEM, N2adsorption-desorption, mass spectrometry, NMR and EDS results showed that the composite molecular sieve contained two pore channels. Py-FTIR results showed that the addition of HY molecular sieves improved the acidity of the composite zeolite. The crystallization mechanism during the growth of FAU/SBA-15 shell was deduced from the influence of crystallization time on the synthesis of FAU/SBA-15 core-shell structured composite molecular sieve. HY dissociated partially in H2SO4solution, and consisted of secondary structural units. This framework structure was more stable than its presence in the isolated form on the same ring or in the absence of Al. Thus it played a guiding role and connected with SBA-15 closely through the Si-O bond. This resulted in the gradual covering of the exterior surface of FAU phase by SBA-15 molecular sieves. The presence of SBA-15 restricted the formation of the other high mass components and increased the selectivity towards ethylbenzene. © 2017 The Author(s).

102.html,Mitigating ammonia emission from agriculture reduces PM2.5pollution in the Hai River Basin in China,"The Hai River Basin (HRB), one of the most populated areas in China, is experiencing high NH3emissions, mostly from agricultural sources, and suffering from strongly enhanced PM2.5concentrations in all urban areas. Further population growth and urbanization projected until 2030 may exacerbate this situation. Here, the NUFER (NUtrient flows in Food chains, Environment and Resources use) and GAINS (Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies) models have been coupled for the first time to understand possible changes of agricultural NH3emission between 2012 and 2030 and their impacts on ambient PM2.5concentrations, and to explore options to improve this situation. Results show that agricultural ammonia emissions in the HRB were 1179 kt NH3in 2012, 45% of which was from the hotspots at or near conurbation areas, including Beijing-Tianjin, Tangshan-Qinhuangdao, Shijiazhuang-Baoding, Dezhou, Handan-Liaocheng, and Xinxiang. Without intervention, agricultural ammonia emissions will further increase by 33% by 2030. The impacts of several scenarios were tested with respect to air pollution. Compared to the business-as-usual scenario, a scenario of improved technology and management combined with human diet optimization could greatly reduce emission (by 60%), and lead to 22–43% and 9–24% decrease of the secondary inorganic aerosols and PM2.5concentrations, respectively, in the hotspots of NH3emissions. Our results further confirmed that ammonia control is needed for air pollution abatement strategies (SO2, NOxand primary PM reduction) to be effective in terms of PM2.5. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources\Center for Agricultural Resources Research\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\Schlossplatz 1\Austria,-,Air pollution; Atmospheric model; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Nitrogen; PM2.5concentration

Focussing on higher education, the book responds to the call for providing alternative conceptual models, other than those originating from the Anglo-Saxon world. The authors take a contextual approach and use the case of Saudi Arabia to understand motivation in a collectivist, highly religious and conservative society of the Middle East. Providing empirical findings from a study carried out at two Saudi universities differing in their religious outlook, this book reveals a hierarchy of needs that is significantly different from the theory proposed by Maslow. Religion, culture and gender are explored in detail as the authors investigate the relevance of Maslow's theory in a region that is of growing interest to policy-makers and practitioners in North America and Europe, offering a truly insightful read to an international audience. © The Author(s) 2018.

As Yury Vlasov wrote, “the constructed system of Soviet sport” saw itself as a bureaucratic apparatus with inherent rules of conduct and underpinned by a system of grassroots organisations, such as sports clubs. 1 This “constructed system” had a general ideology of total record-getting from top to bottom and across all forms of sporting competition. The ideology spread to mass and children’s sport, which were soon viewed as de facto reserves (talent pools) for elite sport—even as the mass sport segment was resource-constrained in the system of physical education and sport. © The Editor(s) and The Author(s) 2018.",Adelfinsky Andrey; Anashvili Valery,Bauman Moscow State Technical University\Moscow\Russian Federation; Centre for Contemporary Philosophy and Social Sciences\Moscow State University\Russian Federation,-,-
1022.html,Pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA phosphate adduct formation in rats treated chronically with enantiomers of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol,"The tobacco-specific lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is metabolically converted to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) in a reaction which is both stereoselective and reversible. NNAL is also a lung carcinogen, with both (R)- NNAL and (S)-NNAL inducing a high incidence of lung tumours in rats. Both NNAL and NNK undergo metabolic activation to intermediates which react with DNA to form pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA adducts, respectively. DNA adduct formation by NNAL and NNK is an important step in their mechanisms of carcinogenesis. In this study, we quantified both pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl DNA phosphate adducts in the lung of rats treated with 5 ppm of (R)-NNAL or (S)-NNAL in drinking water for 10, 30, 50 and 70 weeks. In (R)-NNAL-treated rats, the pyridylhydroxybutyl and pyridyloxobutyl phosphate adducts were 4530-6920 fmol/mg DNA and 46-175 fmol/mg DNA, accounting for 45-51% and 0.3-1% of the total measured DNA phosphate and base adducts, respectively. In (S)-NNAL-treated rats, the two types of phosphate adducts were 3480-4180 fmol/mg DNA and 1180-4650 fmol/mg DNA, accounting for 30-36% and 11-38% of the total adducts, respectively. Distinct patterns of adduct formation were observed, with higher levels of NNAL-derived pyridylhydroxybutyl phosphate adducts and lower levels of NNK-derived pyridyloxobutyl phosphate adducts in the (R)-NNAL treatment group than the (S)- NNAL group. The persistence and increase over time of certain pyridylhydroxybutyl phosphate adducts over the course of the study suggest that these adducts could be useful biomarkers of chronic exposure to NNAL and NNK. The results of this study provide important new information regarding DNA damage by NNAL and NNK, and contribute to understanding mechanisms of tobacco-related carcinogenesis. © The Author(s) 2017.

1023.html,Folate deficiency induces mitotic aberrations and chromosomal instability by compromising the spindle assembly checkpoint in cultured human colon cells,"Folates comprise the essential B9 vitamin that act as cofactors and cosubstrates in one-carbon metabolism for both biosynthesis and methylation of DNA and RNA. Folate deficiency (FD) has been shown to induce chromosomal instability (CIN), yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used human NCM460 colon mucosal cells as a model to investigate the effect of FD on spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a cell-cycle regulatory pathway preventing CIN during mitosis. Cells were maintained in medium containing 1.36 (FD) and 2260 nM (control, FC) folate for 21 days. CIN was measured by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay; mitotic infidelity was determined by aberrant mitosis analysis; SAC activity was assessed by nocodazole-challenge assay, and the expression of core SAC genes was examined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We found that, relative to FC, FD significantly induced CIN in a time-dependent way (P < 0.01). Mitotic cells cultured in FD medium had significant higher frequencies of misalignment, misegregation and spindle multipolarity than those cultured in FC medium (P < 0.01). FD-induced SAC impairment and overriding, resulting premature mitotic exit and cell multinucleation (P < 0.05). Moreover, FD deregulated the expression of several key SAC genes (P < 0.01). Overall, these data are the first to demonstrate that FD substantially compromises SAC network which predisposes cells to mitotic aberrations and CIN. These results establish a new link between folate metabolism and SAC signalling, two pathways that are highly relevant for tumorigenesis. © The Author(s) 2017.

1024.html,Novel mutations in the lipase H gene lead to secretion defects of LIPH in Chinese patients with autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT),"Autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT: OMIM #278150/604379) is a rare hereditary hair disease characterized by tightly curled hair at birth which can lead to sparse hair later in life. The mutations in both LIPH and LPAR6/P2RY5 are responsible for autosomal recessive woolly hair with or without hypotrichosis (ARWH/HT). To conduct clinical and genetic investigations in four patients from three unrelated Chinese Han families with ARWH/HT, we performed mutation screening of LIPH and LPAR6/P2RY5 gene and identified four mutations in LIPH: c.454G>A, c.614A>G, c.736T>A, c.742C>A. c.736T>A and c.742C>A mutations were reported in previous studies, and c.454G>A, c.614A>G were identified for the first time. We carried out functional studies of the two mutants with c.454G>A (p.Gly152Arg, G152R) or c.614A>G (p.His205Arg, H205R). Interestingly, both of them lead to secretion defects of LIPH, which are involved in the pathogenesis of ARWH/HT. © The Author(s) 2018.

We tested whether different intratracheal instillation dispersion media influence the pulmonary toxicity of different nanomaterials. Rodents were intratracheally instilled with 162 μg/mouse/1620 μg/rat carbon black (CB), 67 μg/mouse titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) or 54 μg/mouse carbon nanotubes (CNT). The dispersion media were as follows: water (CB, TiO2); 2% serum in water (CB, CNT, TiO2); 0.05% serum albumin in water (CB, CNT, TiO2); 10% bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in 0.9% NaCl (CB), 10% bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in water (CB) or 0.1% Tween-80 in water (CB). Inflammation was measured as pulmonary influx of neutrophils into bronchoalveolar fluid, and DNA damage as DNA strand breaks in BAL cells by comet assay. Inflammation was observed for all nanomaterials (except 38-nm TiO2) in all dispersion media. For CB, inflammation was dispersion medium dependent. Increased levels of DNA strand breaks for CB were observed only in water, 2% serum and 10% BAL fluid in 0.9% NaCl. No dispersion medium-dependent effects on genotoxicity were observed for TiO2, whereas CNT in 2% serum induced higher DNA strand break levels than in 0.05% serum albumin. In conclusion, the dispersion medium was a determinant of CB-induced inflammation and genotoxicity. Water seemed to be the best dispersion medium to mimic CB inhalation, exhibiting DNA strand breaks with only limited inflammation. The influence of dispersion media on nanomaterial toxicity should be considered in the planning of intratracheal investigations. © The Author(s) 2017.

1026.html,Spectrum of Pig-a mutations in T lymphocytes of rats treated with procarbazine,"Procarbazine is a primary component of antineoplastic combination chemotherapy often used for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is believed that cytostatic and cytotoxic properties of procarbazine are mediated via its interaction with genomic DNA. Procarbazine is a carcinogen in animal models; it is classified as Group 2A compound by IARC. Also it is known as an in vitro and in vivo mutagen and genotoxicant. However, the molecular mechanism by which procarbazine induces mutations is not thoroughly understood and the spectrum of procarbazine-induced in vivo mutations is described insufficiently. We employed flow cytometry-based erythrocyte and T lymphocyte assays in order to quantify the frequencies of cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored surface markers CD59 and CD48 (presumed mutants in the endogenous X-linked Pig-a gene) in rats. The rats were treated once daily with 100 mg/kg procarbazine HCl for 3 days. In addition, we sorted mutant-phenotype spleen T cells and immediately analysed their Pig-a gene using next generation sequencing of dual-indexed multiplex libraries and error-correcting data filtering. More than 100-fold increase in the frequencies of CD59-deficient RBCs was observed at Day 29 after the last administration, and a 10-fold increase in the frequency of CD48-deficient T cells was observed at Days 45 to 50. Sequencing revealed that, in T cells from procarbazinetreated rats, mutations in the Pig-a gene occurred predominantly at A:T basepairs when A was located on the non-transcribed DNA strand. A?T transversion was the most common mutation. Our results suggest that, at least for the transcribed X-linked Pig-a gene, in vivo methyl guanine adducts are not the major contributors to mutations induced by procarbazine. © The Author(s) 2017.

Lithiasis was induced in rats by administrating 0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water for 28 days and was manifested by high Urinary calcium, phosphate, oxalate, protein, uric acid, creatinine and low urinary magnesium Content. The EEET was administered in 250 & 500 mg/kg body weight orally for 28 days along with 0.75% ethylene glycol. Results revealed that Urinary calcium, phosphate, oxalate, protein, uric acid, creatinine was reduced and urinary magnesium level was elevated in diseased group. It also increased the urine volume, thereby reducing the tendency for crystallization. The histopathological studies confirmed the induction of lithiasis as microcrystal deposition was observed in section of kidney from animals treated with ethylene glycol. This was reduced, however, after treatment with the extract. These observations enable us to conclude that EEET is effective against ethylene-glycol induced urolithiasis in albino rats. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation.",-,Ratnam Institute of Pharmacy\Nellore\India,-,Ethylene glycol; Euphorbia thymifolia; Hyperoxaluria; Urolithiasis

Against this background, the present study deals with the development of a high-thermal-conductivity, low-dielectric-constant, and low-loss polymer nanocomposite based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) as the filler in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The nanocomposites were prepared through a facile solution-blending process. Elemental mapping of the prepared nanocomposite indicates the uniform distribution of filler particle in PMMA matrix. An impressive high-thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of around 363% was achieved for nanocomposite of 0.35 Vfof hybrid filler (1.48 W/m K) compared to pristine PMMA (0.32 W/m K). The addition of AgNP reduces the thermal contact resistance (Rc) by bridging individual BNNS, thereby improving thermal transport. Measured TC values were fitted with a theoretical model that showed good agreement. Dielectric measurements performed at radiofrequencies and microwave frequencies revealed that the nanocomposites show a low dielectric constant (<5), low loss (10-2), and very low alternating current conductivity (10-7S/cm). The results suggest that silver-decorated BNNS is a promising hybrid filler for effective thermal management. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Pullanchiyodan Abhilash; Nair Kanakangi S.; Surendran Kuzhichalil P.,Materials Science and Technology Division\National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST-CSIR)\India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)\New Delhi\India,-,-

However, these have been drastically limited by the respective volatility and poor water solubility. The present study investigates the formation of inclusion complexes between BCP and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and shows that these complexes promote a significant improvement of the antiinflammatory, gastric protection, and antioxidant activities relative to neat BCP. It is shown that the solubility of BCP is significantly increased through complexation in phase solubility studies. Inclusion complexes with MβCD in solid state were prepared by three different methods, kneading, rotary evaporation, and lyophilization, with the latter confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics studies. This study provides for the first time a full characterization of inclusion complexes between BCP and MβCD and highlights the impact of complex formation upon pharmacological activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Santos Pauline S.; Souza Luan K.

103.html,Excellent performance of Pt-C/TiO2for methanol oxidation: Contribution of mesopores and partially coated carbon,"Partial deposition of carbon onto mesoporous TiO2(C/TiO2) were prepared as supporting substrate for Pt catalyst development. Carbon deposition is achieved by in-situ carbonization of furfuryl alcohol. The hybrid catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM and exhibited outstanding catalytic activity and stability in methanol oxidation reaction. The heterogeneous carbon coated on mesoporous TiO2fibers provided excellent electrical conductivity and strong interfacial interaction between TiO2support and Pt metal nanoparticles. Methanol oxidation reaction results showed that the activity of Pt-C/TiO2is 3.0 and 1.5 times higher than that of Pt-TiO2and Pt-C, respectively. In addition, the Pt-C/TiO2exhibited a 6.7 times enhanced stability compared with Pt-C after 2000 cycles. The synergistic effect of C/TiO2is responsible for the enhanced activity of Pt-C/TiO2, and its excellent durability could be ascribed to the strong interfacial interaction between Pt nanoparticles and C/TiO2support.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wu Xinbing; Zhuang Wei; Lu Linghong; Li Licheng; Zhu Jiahua; Mu Liwen; Li Wei; Zhu Yudan; Lu Xiaohua,State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering\Nanjing Tech University\China; College of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering\Nanjing Tech University\China; College of Chemical Engineering\Nanjing Forest University\China; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering\The University of Akron\United States,-,Carbon; Interfacial interaction; Mesoporous; Methanol oxidation; Pt nanoparticles; TiO2
1030.html,Probing the critical role of sn content in SnSb@C nanofiber anode on Li storage mechanism and battery performance,"The minimization of the detrimental effects as a result of the drastic volume changes (few hundred times) occurring during repeated alloying−dealloying of lithium with group IV elements, e.g., tin (Sn), is a major challenge. An important design strategy is to have Sn as a component in a binary compound. SnSb is an important example where the antimony (Sb) itself is redox active at a potential higher than that of Sn. The ability of Sb to alloy with Li reduces the Li uptake amount of Sn in SnSb compared to that in bare Sn. Thus, the volume changes of Sn in SnSb will expectedly be much lower compared to that in bare Sn, leading to greater mechanical stability and cyclability. As revealed recently, the complete reformation of SnSb (for a molar ratio of Sn/Sb = 1:1) during charging is not achieved due to the loss of some fraction of Sn. Thus, the molar concentration of Sn and Sb in SnSb is also absolutely important for the optimization of battery performance. We discuss here SnSb with varying compositions of Sn encapsulated inside an electrospun carbon nanofiber (abbreviated as CF). The carbon-nanofiber matrix not only provides electron transport pathways for the redox process but also provides ample space to accommodate the drastic volume changes occurring during successive charge and discharge cycles. The systematic changes in the chemical composition of SnSb minimize the instabilities in SnSb structure as well as replenish any loss in Sn during repeated cycling. The composition plays a very crucial role, as magnitude of specific capacities and cyclability of SnSb are observed to depend on the variable percentage of Sn. SnSb-75-25-CF, which contains excess Sn, exhibits the highest specific capacity of 550 mAh g−1after 100 cycles in comparison with pure SnSb (1:1) anode material at a current density of 0.2 A g−1and shows excellent rate capability over widely varying current densities (0.2−5 A g−1). © 2017 American Chemical Society",Das Suman; Guru Row Tayur N.; Bhattacharyya Aninda J.,Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit\Indian Institute of Science\India,-,-

1032.html,"Contractions of degenerate quadratic Algebras, abstract and geometric","uadratic algebras are generalizations of Lie algebras which include the symmetry algebras of 2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions as special cases. The superintegrable systems are exactly solvable physical systems in classical and quantum mechanics. Distinct superintegrable systems and their quadratic algebras can be related by geometric contractions, induced by Bôcher contractions of the conformal Lie algebra so(4,ℂ) to itself. In 2 dimensions there are two kinds of quadratic algebras, nondegenerate and degenerate. In the geometric case these correspond to 3 parameter and 1 parameter potentials, respectively. In a previous paper we classified all abstract parameter-free nondegenerate quadratic algebras in terms of canonical forms and determined which of these can be realized as quadratic algebras of 2D nondegenerate superintegrable systems on constant curvature spaces and Darboux spaces, and studied the relationship between Bôcher contractions of these systems and abstract contractions of the free quadratic algebras. Here we carry out an analogous study of abstract parameter-free degenerate quadratic algebras and their possible geometric realizations. We show that the only free degenerate quadratic algebras that can be constructed in phase space are those that arise from superintegrability. We classify all Bôcher contractions relating degenerate superintegrable systems and, separately, all abstract contractions relating free degenerate quadratic algebras. We point out the few exceptions where abstract contractions cannot be realized by the geometric Bôcher contractions. © 2017, Institute of Mathematics.

We successfully observed the structural change between the G-quadruplex and the unstructured single strand by19F NMR spectroscopy. The thermodynamic parameters of these DNA G-quadruplex aptamers were also determined from the19F NMR signals. We further showed that the19F NMR method can be used to observe the complex formed by TBA G-quadruplex and thrombin.

In principle, their applications are almost limitless, as they are able to almost completely reduce the impact of interferents and can be applied to distinguish samples of extreme complexity as for example broths from different stages of fermentation. Nevertheless, their applications outside the three principal sample types are, in comparison, rather scarce. In this review, we would like to take a closer look on what are real capabilities of electronic tongue systems, what can be achieved using mixed sensor arrays and by introduction of biosensors or molecularly imprinted polymers in the matrix.

It is necessary to develop lily cultivars with high qualities. Therefore, highly efficient propagation systems are needed following release of elite cultivars. In this study, we used taurine treatment to improve the growth conditions including shoot and bulb formation, fresh weight gain, and reduction of rooting and browning. We experimentally evaluated the effect of taurine as a growth stimulator, at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/l. The results showed that 20 mg of taurine enhanced shoot formation by 85% and increased fresh weight 5.5-fold, which was higher than the approximately four-fold increase in the control. In addition, multiple bulb formation rate was increased by 80% and rooting by 82% following exposure to 20 mg/l of taurine. The efficiency of taurine treatment was higher than that of control with 50% multiple bulb formation rate and 60% rooting rate. The browning was 10.6% at 2.5 mg/l of taurine when compared with 0.8% at 20 mg/l. Taurine showed a positive effect on the overall growth of lily plants in terms of increased fresh weight, shoot formation rate, rooting, and formation of multiple bulbs, indicating that taurine can be used as an alternative to amino acids or as an antioxidant such as citrate and vitamin C in plant tissue culture. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Lee Sang-Hee; Yang Hwan-Rae; Kim Sun Tae; Jun Tae Hwan; Kim Yong Chul; Kim Jong Bo,Department of Biotechnology\College of Biomedical and Health Sciences\South Korea; Department of Plant Bioscience\Pusan National University\South Korea,-,Browning; Lily; Mass propagation; Regeneration; Taurine

However, it is also known to have a role as a stress signaling molecule in response to environmental changes. Anabaena sp. and N. oculata are microorganisms which are abundantly found in Malaysia’s freshwater and marine ecosystem. However, not much studies have been done especially in regards to thiamine biosynthesis. This work aimed to amplify of gene transcripts coding for thiamine biosynthesis enzymes besides looking at the expression of thiamine biosynthesis genes upon stress application. Various stress inducers were applied to the cultures and RNA was extracted at different time points. The first two genes, ThiC and ThiG/Thi4 encoding enzymes of the pyrimidine and thiazole branch respectively in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway were identified and amplified. The expression of the genes were analysed via RT- PCR and the intensity of bands were analysed using ImageJ software. The results showed up to 4-fold increase in the expression of ThiC and ThiG gene transcript as compared to control sample in Anabaena sp. ThiC gene in N. oculata showed an expression of 6-fold higher as compared to control sample. In conclusion, stresses induced the expression of the gene coding for one of the most important enzymes in thiamine biosynthesis pathway. This is an agreement with the hypothesis that overexpression of thiamine is crucial in assisting plants to combat abiotic stresses. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Fern Lee Li; Zainal Abidin Aisamuddin Ardi; Balia Yusof Zetty Norhana,Department of Biochemistry\Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences\Malaysia; Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology\Institute of Bioscience\Malaysia,-,Cyanobacteria; Gene expression; Microalgae; Stress; Thiamine; Vitamin B1

Therefore it is necessary to develop the optimal production system for rapid and cost-effective propagation of mulberry. Our studies focused on establishing an acclimatization method for the successful plantlet production of new cultivar ‘Cheongsu’ which was transferred ex vitro after in vitro culture. In particular, effect of abscisic acid (ABA) addition into the last subculture medium on plantlet response to subsequent ex vitro transfer and its growth was investigated. During acclimatization, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets were significantly lower than those of non-treated plantlets. Net photosynthetic rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets decreased after ex vitro transfer but increased after 14 days, and it was mostly higher than that of non-treated plantlets. Moreover, relative water content as well as chlorophyll contents and its ratio were also higher in ABA-pretreated plantlets. On the other hand, proline was considerably higher than in control plantlets. After 1 month of ex vitro transfer, survival rate of ABA-pretreated plantlets was 85.6%, which increased by 29.1% in comparison with control (56.5%). More vigorous growth was also observed in ABA-pretreated plantlets. From these results, it was found that application of ABA to the last subculture medium could improve acclimatization and promote survival of mulberry plantlets after ex vitro transfer, inducing water stress tolerance and alleviating abiotic stresses. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Huh Yoon Sun; Lee Joung Kwan; Nam Sang Young,Horticultural Research Division\Chungcheongbuk-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services\South Korea,-,Abscisic acid; Acclimatization; Ex vitro transfer; Mulberry; Water stress

The full length of DcAFP coding region in accordance with the previous report was isolated from young leaves of carrot and recombined into a plant transformation vector. Ethylene inhibitors such as silver nitrate and aminoethoxyvinylglycin (AVG) supplemented in a co-cultivation medium distinctly increased frequency of shoot regeneration when explants were sub-cultured in a selection medium: particularly ten-fold higher in treatment with 0.1 mg/L AVG than one without ethylene inhibitor. Among various antibiotics and their concentrations, the combination of 150 mg/L cefotaxime plus 150 mg/L ClavamoxTMwas selected for elimination of Agrobacterium cells in addition to minimization of adverse effect on shoot regeneration, while 50 mg/L kanamycin monosulfate effectively suppressed regeneration of non-transgenic shoots. Applying the elucidated culture condition, we finally obtained a total of 5 transgenic ‘Kyoho’ plantlets with DcAFP, of which integration with the grapevine genome and transcription was confirmed by nucleic acid analyses. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Shin Hye Young; Kim Gi Hoon; Kang Sang Jae; Han Jeung-Sul; Choi Cheol,Department of Horticultural Science\College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\South Korea; School of Applied Life Science\College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\South Korea; Department of Ecological Environment\College of Ecology and Environmental Science\South Korea; Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology\Kyungpook National University\South Korea,-,Agrobacterium overgrowth; Antibiotics concentration; Cold-tolerance; Genotype; Vitis vinifera

They were mixed infected by Apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) and Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), which are major viruses attacking apples. A total of 31 callus lines (> 10 mm in diameter) were obtained by culturing the explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 3.0 mg/L benzyladenine (BA) and 0.1 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and they were subjected to RT- PCR analysis for virus detection. A high rate of virus elimination (expressed as the percentage of calli that did not amplify during RT- PCR, i.e., RT- PCR negative calli per total number of calli obtained) was achieved for ACLSV (100%), ASSVd (93.7%), and ASPV (93.7%), whereas it was only 25.8% for ASGV. ASPV was detected in the presence of 2 ~ 3 bracts. Simultaneous virus elimination of ASSVd, ASPV, ACLSV, and ASGV occurred during the meristem culture, in which the early stages of the dormant buds (Stage 1) were used, because ASGV was mostly eliminated during that stage.

104.html,Synthesis of a fluorine-free polymeric water-repellent agent for creation of superhydrophobic fabrics,"A non-fluorinated polymeric alkylsilane, poly(isobutyl methacrylate-co-3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) (PIT), is designed and synthesized to replace the commercial long-chain perfluoroalkylsilane (FAS) water-repellent agent. The superhydrophobic polyester fabrics are prepared by anchoring sol-gel derived silica nanoparticles onto alkali-treated polyester fabric surfaces and subsequently hydrophobilizing with PIT, using FAS as control. The surface chemical composition, surface morphology, wetting behavior and durability of the modified polyester fabrics are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (XPS) and video-based contact angle goniometer, respectively. The results show that a porous silica layer could be successfully fabricated onto the surface of polyester fabric through base-catalyzed sol-gel process with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as precursor, incorporating additional nanostructured roughness essential for superhydrophobicity. At the same time, such a silica primer layer could provide both secondary reactive moieties (−Si − OH) for the subsequent surface hydrophobization and acceptable adhesion at the silica-polyester fabric interface. When silica modified polyester fabric (SiO2@ fabric) is hydrophobized by PIT solution (10 mg/mL), excellent water-repellency could be obtained. The water contact angle is up to 154° and the sliding angle is about 5°. Compared with small molecule water-repellent agent FAS, PIT modified SiO2@ fabric exhibits greatly improved solvent resistance under ultra-sonication, abrasion and simulated laundering durability. The anti-stain property of PIT-modified SiO2@ fabric is also evaluated by using different aqueous colored solutions.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Shen Keke; Yu Miao; Li Qianqian; Sun Wei; Zhang Xiting; Quan Miao; Liu Zhengtang; Shi Suqing; Gong Yongkuan,Key Laboratory of Synthetic and Natural Functional Molecule Chemistry of Ministry of Education\College of Chemistry & Material Science\China; Shaanxi Baotashan Paint Stock Co.\Ltd\China,-,Durability; Fluorine-free polymeric alkylsilane; Polyester fabrics; Water-repellency
1040.html,Development of a marker system to discern the flowering type in brassica rapa crops,"Flowering is one of the most important development traits related to the production of Brassica rapa crops. After planting, a sudden low temperature triggers premature flowering, which leads to a reduction in the yield and quality of harvested production. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of flowering control is important in the agricultural productivity for preventing Brassica rapa crops. Vernalization is generally known as the main factor of flowering in the Brassica plant. However, in the subspecies of Brassica rapa, some accession such as Yellow sarson and Komatsuna display the flowering phenotype without vernalization. Circadian genes, which diurnally regulate plant physiology, have a role for photoperiodic flowering but are related to the regulation of the vernalizarion mechanism. In this report, the 22 B. rapa accession were divided into two groups, vernalization and non-vernalization, and the sequenced circadian gene, BrPRR1s. Among them, the BrPRR1b gene was found to have deletion regions, which could classify the two groups. The PCR primer was designed to amplify a short band of 422bp in the vernalization type and a long band of 451bp in the non-vernalization type. This primer set was applied to distinguish the flowering types in the 43 B. rapa accession and 4 Brassica genus crop, Broccoli, cabbage, mustard, and rape. The PCR analysis results and flowering time information of each crop demonstrated that the primer set can be used as marker to discern the flowering type in Brassica crops. This marker system can be applied to the B. rapa breeding when selecting the flowering character of new progenies or introducing varieties at an early stage. In addition, these results displayed that the circadian clock genes can be a good strategy for the flowering control of B. rapa crops. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Kim Jin A; Kim Jung Sun; Hong Joon Ki; Lee Yeon-Hee; Lee Soo In; Jeong Mi-Jeong,National Academy of Agricultural Science\Rural Development Administration\South Korea,-,Brassica rapa accession; BrPRR1; Circardian clock genes; Molecular marker; Vernalization
1041.html,"Morphological characteristics, chemical and genetic diversity of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus l.) genotypes","The kenaf plant is used widely as food and in traditional folk medicine. This study evaluated the morphological characteristics, functional compounds, and genetic diversity of 32 kenaf cultivars from a worldwide collection. We found significant differences in the functional compounds of leaves from all cultivars, including differences in levels of chlorogenic acid isomer (CAI), chlorogenic acid (CA), kaempferol glucosyl rhamnoside isomer (KGRI), kaempferol rhamnosyl xyloside (KRX), kaemperitrin (KAPT) and total phenols (TPC). The highest TPC, KAPT, CA, and KRX contents were observed in the C22 cultivars. A significant correlation was observed between flowering time and DM yield, seed yield, and four phenolic compounds (KGRI, KRX, CAI, and TPC) (P < 0.01). To assess genetic diversity, we used 80 simple sequence repeats (SSR) primer sets and identified 225 polymorphic loci in the kenaf cultivars. The polymorphism information content and genetic diversity values ranged from 0.11 to 0.79 and 12 to 0.83, with average values of 0.39 and 0.43, respectively. The cluster analysis of the SSR markers showed that the kenaf genotypes could be clearly divided into three clusters based on flowering time. Correlations analysis was conducted for the 80 SSR markers; morphological, chemical and growth traits were found for 15 marker traits (corolla, vein, petal, leaf, stem color, leaf shape, and KGRI content) with significant marker-trait correlations.

Thus, we focused on the generation of senescence-delayed transgenic trees to enhance biomass production. The PagMYC2, a gene containing the basic helix-loop-helix domain, was selected as a candidate for a senescence-delayed transgenic tree. The PagMYC2 gene was specifically induced after treatment with phytohormone jasmonic acid, and upregulated by abiotic stresses such as salinity, osmotic pressure and a low temperature. The constitutive overexpression of the PagMYC2 delayed the leaf senescence and inhibited chlorophyll degradation in the transgenic poplars. Leaf senescence analysis was performed in the leaf tissues of the PagMYC2-over-expression transgenic poplars. The transgenic poplars exhibited higher photochemical efficiency than did a wild type plant under a short-day condition (6 hours light/ 18 hours darkness) or a low temperature condition (15°C) that was similar to the weather conditions of autumn. These results suggest that the PagMYC2 is a useful genetic resource to improve biomass production, which is able to sustain growth with senescence-delayed leaves for a long time in autumn. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Choi Hyunmo; Bae Eun-Kyung; Cho Jin Seong; Lee Hyoshin; Choi Young-Im,Department of Plant and Environmental New Resources\Kyung Hee University\South Korea; Forest Biotechnology Division\National Institute of Forest Science\South Korea,-,Gene expression; Leaf senescence; MYC2; Transgenic poplar
1043.html,Evaluation of resistance to pierce’s disease among grapevine cultivars by using the culture filtrates produced from xylella fastidiosa,"This study investigated whether culture filtrates produced by Xylella fastidiosa can be used to determine the varietal susceptibility to Pierce's disease in grapevines (Vitis spp.) as a substitute for pathogen inoculation or field screening. A bioassay of grape leaves with culture filtrates from the pathogen showed that their phytotoxicities were active and host-selective. Ethyl acetate extracts from them also showed toxicities and host selectivity in both bunches of grapes and muscadine grapes. The sensitive range of plants to the culture filtrates and their ethyl acetate extracts was consistent with the host range of the Pierce’s disease pathogen. Susceptible cultivars are sensitive to even highly diluted culture filtrates, while resistant cultivars were not affected even at their original culture filtrates. Susceptible cultivars were more sensitive to the undiluted culture filtrate than were highly diluted culture filtrates, and the younger leaves were the most sensitive to the culture filtrates in grapes. Although some European grape cultivars showed moderately susceptibility in this study, the determination of varietal resistance to Pierce’s disease by the treatment of culture filtrates of pathogens could provide valuable information for the preliminary selection of genetic resources and seedlings from hybridization in a disease resistant grape breeding program. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Park Myung Soo; Lu Jiang; Yun Hae Keun,School of Biological Sciences\Institute of Microbiology\South Korea; School of Agriculture and Biology\Shanghai Jiao Tong University\China; Viticulture Center Florida\A and M University\United States; Department of Horticulture and Life Science\Yeungnam University\South Korea,-,Disease resistance; Genetic resources; Phytoto-xicity; Screening; Vitis

In this study, we used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and greenhouse testing to study the genetic diversity and quinclorac resistance levels of 15 Echinochloa crus-galli populations in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and the state of Arkansas, U.S. The quinclorac resistance of Echinochloa crus-galli populations in Vietnam was confirmed; 9 populations were resistant to quinclorac with R/S ratios ranging from 1.9 to 6.3. Six oligonucleotide primers produced a total of 55 repeatable bands of which 46 were polymorphic (83.3% average) among the 15 populations. Genetic distance was calculated, and cluster analysis separated the 15 populations into 2 main clusters with the genetic distances within the clusters ranging from 0.09 to 0.39. The two main clusters were divided into 7 subclusters, and the quinclorac resistant and susceptible populations were located randomly within each subcluster. Six out of 13 weed populations from Vietnam belonged to one cluster and a single Echinochloa species. The remaining 7 populations were identified as potentially different species in the Echinochloa genus. Nine Echinochloa populations from Vietnam were tested and identified as quinclorac resistant. The connection between quinclorac resistance levels and weed groups defined by RAPD analysis in the study is unclear; the quinclorac resistance of each resistant population could have evolved individually, regardless of differences in genetic diversity and location of the sampled populations. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Le Duy; Nguyen Chon M.; Mann Richard K.; Yerkes Carla N.; Kumar Bobba V.

The results of study: chopped segments of leaf blades, stipes, rhizomes and roots were cultured on a 1/2MS medium supplemented with 0.1% activated charcoal. Among these explant types, only the rhizome segments produced young sporophyte, regenerating vigorously on a 1/8MS medium. Adjusting the sucrose concentration to 2% and supplement to 50 mg･L-1NaH2PO4in the 1/8MS medium proved to be more efficient for plant regeneration. Consequently, the addition of 0.1% activated charcoal to a modified 1/8MS medium (2% sucrose, 50 mg･L-1NaH2PO4, pH 5.8 and 0.8% agar) yielded the highest sporophyte regeneration. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Kwon Hyuk Joon; Shin So Lim; Lee Cheol Hee; Kim Soo-Young,National Institute of Biological Resources\Incheon\South Korea; Brain Korea 21\Center for Bio-Resource Development\South Korea,-,Fern; Masspropagation; NaH2PO4; Pteridophyta; Sporophyte

The expression levels of PPI1 and CI21B genes were lineraly elevated from day 1 to day 3, while the opposite trend was observed for CBF4 and CI21A. In addition, the expression of the genes CI21A and CI21B varied, along with specific tissues (leaf, stem, and tuber) and the treatment periods. Therefore, potato shoot tips were cryopreserved with LS and PVS2 containing different oncentrations of AFP. It can thus be inferred that the presence of AFP in LS and PVS2 was likely to elevate expression pattern of the genes. Furthermore, the concentration of AFP (1,500 ng/ml for LS and 500 ng/mg for PVS2) was the best for the cryopreservation of potatoes. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Seo Ji-Hyang; Jeon Su Min; Naing Aung Htay; Han Jeung Sul; Park In Hwan; Kim Chang-Kil,Department of Horticulture\Kyungpook National University\South Korea; Department of Landscape Architecture\Kyungpook National University\South Korea,-,LS; PVS2; Real-time PCR; Vitrification

The results showed that N-GANM with an interesting nanomesh structure on the graphene sheets maintained the 3D architecture of graphene aerogel (GA). Furthermore, it exhibited excellent electrochemical capacitive behavior and the specific capacitance value (290.0 F g−1at 1 A g−1) remained approximately 90.3% after 2000 cycles in the three-electrode system. In addition, N-GANM displayed an energy density of 30.9 Wh kg−1at the power density of 450.3 W kg−1and excellent cycling stability retention (98%) after 10,000 cycles in the two-electrode symmetric device. The resulting N-GANM was expected to be a much favorable supercapacitor electrode material due to the heteroatom-doping and its unique porous structure.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Su Xiao-Li; Fu Lin; Cheng Ming-Yu; Yang Jing-He; Guan Xin-Xin; Zheng Xiu-Cheng,College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering\Zhengzhou University\China; School of Chemical Engineering and Energy\Zhengzhou University\China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Energy Materials Chemistry (Ministry of Education)\Nankai University\China,-,3D graphene architecture; Electrochemical properties; Graphene aerogel nanomesh; Incorporation of nitrogen; Supercapacitors

Differences in gene expression between red flesh apple cultivar, ‘Redfield’ and white flesh apple cultivar, ‘Granny Smith’ were investigated by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expressed sequence tag (EST) of clones from the red flesh apple cultivar and white flesh apple cultivar were selected for nucleotide sequence determination and homology searches. High resolution melting (HRM) technique measures temperature induced strand separation of short PCR amplicons, and is able to detect variation as small as one base difference between red flesh apple cultivars and white flesh apple cultivars. We applied high resolution melting (HRM) analysis to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based on the predicted SNP information derived from the apple EST database. All 103 pairs of SNPs were discriminated, and the HRM profiles of amplicons were established. Putative SNPs were screened from the apple EST contigs by HRM analysis displayed specific difference between 10 red flesh apple cultivars and 11 white flesh apple cultivars. In this study, we report an efficient method to develop SNP markers from an EST database with HRM analysis in apple. These SNP markers could be useful for apple marker assisted breeding and provide a good reference for relevant research on molecular mechanisms of color variation in apple cultivars. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Kim Se Hee; Park Seo Jun; Cho Kang Hee; Lee Han Chan; Lee Jung Woo; Choi In Myung,Ginseng Research Division\National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science\South Korea; Fruit Research Division\National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science\South Korea,-,Anthocyanin; Breeding; Cultivars; Gene expression; Transcription factor

1052.html,Genotype analysis of genes involved in increasing grain number per panicle in rice germplasm,"ARice is an important staple food in the world and rice yield is one of the main traits for rice breeding. Several genes involved in increasing the yield have been identified through map-based gene cloning within natural variations in rice. These identified genes are good targets for introducing a genetic trait in molecular breeding. Here, we chose five genes reported to be involved in increasing grain number per panicle in rice; Gn1a, dep1, Apo1, Ghd7, and Nal1. We developed In/Del markers for Gn1a, and dep1, Apo1, and applied the reported SNP markers for Ghd7 and Nal1. We were easily able to examine the genotype of each gene on agarose gel. We tested the genotypes on 479 rice resources that we held with evaluated molecular markers. According to the genotype of each gene, rice resources were divided into 13 haplotypes, and most of the Indica and Japonica varieties were included in haplotypes 1 and 13, respectively. When we examined the effect of each gene on grain number per panicle and panicle number per plant, panicle number per plant in the yield negative allele group for each gene was reduced by approximately 0.3 to 0.8 compared to that in the yield positive allele group. However, the number of yield positive alleles for each gene was higher by about 21 to 27 grains per panicle than that of yield negative alleles. Although most of the varieties were grouped in haplotypes 1 and 13, we believe that this genotype information with evaluated molecular markers will be useful in rice breeding for increasing the yield with grain number per panicle. © Korean Society for Plant BioTechnology.",Shin Dongjin; Kim Tae-Heon; Lee Ji-Yoon; Cho Jun-Hyun; Lee Jong-Hee; Song You-Chun; Park Dong-Soo; Oh Myeong-Kyu,Research Policy Bureau\RDA\South Korea; Department of Southern Area Crop Science\National Institute of Crop Science\South Korea,-,Grain number per panicle; Molecular marker; Rice; Yield

To disclose the underlying mechanism behind the three-dimensional (3-D) growth pattern of magnesium alloy dendrite, an anisotropy function was developed in light of the spherical harmonics and experimental findings. Relevant atomistic simulations based on density functional theory were then performed to determine the anisotropic surface energy along different crystallographic directions, and the corresponding anisotropic strength was quantified via the least-square regression. Results of phase field simulations showed that the proposed anisotropy function could satisfactorily describe the 3-D growth pattern of the α-Mg dendrite observed in the experiments. Our investigations shed great insight into understanding the pattern formation of the hcp magnesium alloy dendrite at an atomic level. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Du Jinglian; Zhang Ang; Guo Zhipeng; Yang Manhong; Li Mei; Xiong Shoumei,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Laboratory for Advanced Materials Processing Technology\China; Materials Research Department\Research and Innovation Center\United States,-,-

Reactions with ethylene using 1-3 in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) afforded a mixture of oligomer and polymers, and the compositions were affected by the imido ligand employed. By contrast, 1-3 exhibited remarkable catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of Me2AlCl; the phenylimido complex (2) exhibited the highest activity [80 100 kg-PE/mol-V·h turn over frequency (TOF, 2 850 000 h-1, 792 s-1)]. The ethylene copolymerizations with norbornene afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight distributions and compositions [e.g., Mn= 1.71-2.66 × 106, Mw/Mn= 2.27-2.53]. On the basis of V nuclear magnetic resonance (51V NMR), electron spin resonance, and V K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the catalyst solution, the observed difference in the catalyst performance in the presence of (between) MAO and Me2AlCl cocatalyst should be due to the formation of different catalytically active species with different oxidation states. Apparent changes in the oxidation state were observed in the (especially in the NMR and XANES) spectra upon addition of Me2AlCl, whereas no significant changes in the spectra were observed in presence of MAO. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Nomura Kotohiro; Oshima Mari; Mitsudome Takato; Harakawa Hitoshi; Hao Peng; Tsutsumi Ken; Nagai Go; Ina Toshiaki; Takaya Hikaru; Sun Wen-Hua; Yamazoe Seiji,Department of Chemistry\Faculty of Science and Engineering\Japan; Key Laboratory of Engineering Plastics\Institute of Chemistry\China; Department of Materials Engineering Science\Osaka University\Japan; Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI\SPring-8)\Japan,-,-

Those nanobioconjugates selectively interact with cell surface receptors and induce endocytosis followed by intracellular trafficking. However, this approach requires functional modification of biomolecules that may alter their biochemical activity. Here, we show that supramolecular host-guest chemistry can be utilized as an alternative approach in nanoparticle functionalization and selective cell labeling. We have used cyclodextrin-conjugated quantum dots (QDs) for supramolecular host-guest interaction-based functionalization with folate (QD-folate) and riboflavin (QD-riboflavin), where cyclodextrin acts as a host for the folate/riboflavin guest. We demonstrate that QD-folate and QD-riboflavin selectively label cells that have over-expressed folate/riboflavin receptors and induce the endocytosis pathway similar to covalently conjugated folate-/riboflavin-based nanoprobes. However, labeling is highly sensitive to the molar ratio of folate/riboflavin to cyclodextrin and incubation time. The presented functionalization/labeling approach is unique as it does not require covalent conjugation and may be extended for in vivo targeting application via simultaneous delivery of host and guest molecules. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Pal Suman; Dalal Chumki; Jana Nikhil R.,Centre for Advanced Materials\Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science\India,-,-

The exteroceptive behavioral models such as elevated plus maze, Morris water maze, Radial arm maze, Y maze and Open field test were used to evaluate the learning and memory, whereas scopolamine is the natural ageing inducing amnesia served as interoceptive models. Parameters like Escape Latency Time (ELT), Time Spent in Target Quadrant (TSTQ), Transfer latency (TL), Peripheral movements and Rearings alternation to estimate the short-term memory and determination of brain Acetyl cholinesterase and β-Amyloid protein levels.

However, our knowledge about cyanobacterial biogeography in the subtropics, particularly in lotic ecosystems, is still very limited and the relationship of blooms to temperature and precipitation remains unclear. We took advantage of a comprehensive database of field data compiled over several years (1997 to 2015) to compare cyanobacteria biomass and distribution between lentic and lotic subtropical freshwaters (36 ecosystems, 30°–35°S) and to investigate the role of water temperature and precipitation as significant predictors in eutrophic ecosystems. A filamentous Nostocales, Dolichospermum (Anabaena), was the most widely distributed and frequent genus in the region of the study, followed by the colonial Microcystis, supporting observations of a global latitudinal pattern. Similar total cyanobacteria biovolumes (TCB) were found in lentic and lotic ecosystems, but the proportion of Dolichospermum was higher in lotic ecosystems. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), we found that temperature and rainfall explained 27% of the variation in TCB in lotic ecosystems, while temperature explained 19 and 28% of Dolichospermum and Microcystis biovolume, respectively. In lentic ecosystems, accumulated rainfall explained 34% of the variation of Microcystis biovolume while temperature explained 64%. Our results imply that the increase in extreme meteorological events and temperature predicted by climate models will promote increasingly severe cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic subtropical freshwaters. Our analysis provides new information about the occurrence of bloom-forming cyanobacteria for southeastern South America and thus fills an important knowledge gap for subtropical freshwaters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Haakonsson Signe; Rodríguez-Gallego Lorena; Somma Andrea; Bonilla Sylvia,Grupo de Ecología y Fisiología de Fitoplancton\Sección Limnología\Uruguay; Polo de Desarrollo Universitario\Ecología Funcional de Sistemas Acuáticos\Uruguay,-,Climate change; CyanoHAB; Dolichospermum; Freshwaters; Microcystis; Rivers

This study largely deals with understanding the effect of electric stress on catalytic as well as noncatalytic components of antioxidant machinery in insect using Drosophila as a model system. The effect of dietary supplement of ascorbic acid and abhrak bhasma in management of elwectric shock has also been evaluated. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase enzymes were assessed as a part of catalytic component while, total GSH content, GSH:GSSG ratio, free radical scavenging capacity were studied as a part of non-catalytic component of antioxidant machinery of cells. Along with these parameters, the molecular effect at transcription levels of cncC (Nrf-2), hsp70 genes as well as the effect on lipid peroxidation was evaluated in response to electric shock. It was observed that ascorbic acid as a dietary supplement, in general, show protective role in electric stress. Abhrak bhasma, on the contrary, negatively affect various antioxidant parameters.

In the present scenario researchers have increased their focus the relationship with stress and cognition. Now it is well established that chronic stress has a negative impact on cognition. It has been learnt that stress leads to the cellular changes in hippocampus wherein a part of the limbic system which is very important for memory processes is affected. It is learnt that the most likely cause for hypertension is emotional stress and anxiety. Hypertension may further become the route cause for cardiovascular disorders (Alderson A L et al., 2009). Heartfulness meditation would be one of the meditation techniques when practiced regularly will have magical effects on an individual with sedentary life style full of stress and anxiety (Littleton, A. C et al., 1981). The studies have proved that heartfulness meditation has a positive role in reducing stress and preventing the individuals from greater health complications like anxiety, depression and physical ill health. As it is studied that stress has an effect on cognition also, in the present study we tried to learn the effect of heartfulness meditation on perceived stress and cognition in the patients with hypertension. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",Mishra Soumya; Sailesh Kumar Sai; Bashetti Srilatha; Reddy Udaya Kumar,Department of Physiology\Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences\India; Department of Physiology\DM Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences (DMWIMS)\India; Department of Biochemistry\Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences & Research\India; Department of Physiology\Saveetha Medical College\India,-,Alkaloids; Antimicrobial; Aquatic plants; Phenolic compounds; Tannins

Additionally, understanding some of the environmental factors and their relationship to the occurrence of breast cancer was proposed for this study. Blood samples were collected from 50 women at ages between 21-71 years old, that suffered from breast cancer and 50 healthy women who are considered as a control group. The samples were placed in EDTA-based tubes. Then, the samples were kept frozen at -20 ̊C for later DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory procedures. The results of the mutation analyses of the CYP1A1 gene for the cancer and the healthy groups revealed that the occurrence frequencies of the homozygous wild type isoleucine/isoleucine were 52% and 26% respectively. While they were 42% and 60% respectively for the homozygous mutant Val/Val. Moreover, the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile type showed presence at 6% and 14% respectively. The statistical analyses confirmed that the incidence of the breast cancer could increase with genetic trait of the homozygous mutant Val/Val in a difference rate of 1.4 and confidence interval at 3.337-0.587. The findings of this study also declared that the women who carried the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile and their menstrual cycle started at the ages between 14-17 years old had 4 times of the risk factor of developing breast cancer. The study also revealed that there were no significant differences between the women who had breast cancer if they had early or late menopause. Finally, the study results showed that there was 3 times risk factor of developing breast cancer in uneducated women when linked to the genotypic trait Val/Ile in a difference rate of 3.2 and confidence interval of 40.057-0.265. It has been concluded that the risk factor of breast cancer was increased in the uneducated women in the presence of the Val/Ile genotype. This could be reasoned to the lifestyle of exposing to chemicals, paints, smoking, and many environmental carcinogens. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",Mutar Hayder Ayyal,Department of Medical Mathematics\College of Science\Iraq,-,Breast cancer; CYP1A1 gene polymorphism; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

The structures and morphologies of the resultant samples are investigated. The consequences suggest that Ti3+self-doped mesoporous black TiO2/SiO2composites have a high surface area of ∼300 m2g−1, a relative large pore size of ∼4 nm and pore volume of ∼0.35 cm3g−1. The introduction of SiO2stabilizes the mesoporous networks and prevents the collapse of the channels during the calcination process, which not only improves the crystallinity of TiO2, but also maintains the mesoporous frameworks. The prepared composite with narrow bandgap of ∼2.79 eV exhibits outstanding property for removal of dye and the production of H2under AM 1.5 irradiation, which is higher compared with the pristine TiO2composite. This is attributed to the Ti3+self-doping reducing the bandgap and benefiting the absorption of visible light, the mesoporous frameworks favoring the diffusion of reactants and products, and providing abundant surface active sites.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hu Mengqiao; Cao Yan; Li Zhenzi; Yang Shilin; Xing Zipeng,Department of Environmental Science\School of Chemistry and Materials Science\China; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics\Harbin Medical University\China,-,Composite; Hydrogen generation; Mesoporous TiO2/SiO2; Ti3+self-doping; Visible-light-driven photocatalysis
1070.html,"Methanol extracts of four selected marine sponges induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7","Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women worldwide. However, due to limited chemotherapeutic efficacy of current anticancer drugs, various natural products have been screened for novel alternative chemotherapeutic agents. Marine environment offers vast diversity of living organisms that provide compounds with impressive structural diversity and drug-like properties. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of cell death exerted by marine sponges on human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Four species, namely Aaptos sp., Stryphuous ponderosus, Theonella sp. and Xestospongia sp, were selected for this study. Methanol extracts from three species produced potent cytotoxicity effects with IC50 values at 72hr of less than 30μg/ml in the order of Aaptos sp. > S. ponderosus > Theonella sp. Due to the lack of studies on S. ponderosus, extract from this species was then used to determine its mechanisms of cell death. MCF-7 cell death exerted by the extract was found to be mediated by apoptosis based on the presence of DNA fragmentation in treated cells. Treatment of cells with the extract increased the levels of of caspase 3 suggesting that the protein was responsible in triggering the DNA fragmentation. In addition, the extract also induced the levels of caspases 8 and 9 and the levels of caspase 8 was higher than the latter suggesting that extrinsic was the major pathway that involved in inducing apoptosis. The apoptotic-induced cytototoxicity activity of the methanol extract of S. ponderosus may be due to the presence alkaloid and terpenoid compounds, and thus, may have the potential to be developed further as candidates for chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",Hudayah Tuti; Taib Mariam; Ismail Noraznawati; Muhammad Tengku Sifzizul Tengku,Institute of Marine Biotechnology\Universiti Malaysia Terengganu\Malaysia; School of Fundamental Science\Universiti Malaysia Terengganu\Malaysia,-,Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Caspases; Marine extract; S. ponderosus

Although it is known to be associated with green tide, its contribution to the natural attenuation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in seawater has not been evaluated. In this study, the removal of phenanthrene using U. prolifera collected from coastal water with green tide blooming was investigated. The results showed that phenanthrene could be removed efficiently in the presence of both the live and heat-killed U. prolifera. The phenanthrene concentrations of the live algae treatment decreased smoothly from 10.00 to 0.80 μg L− 1through the whole process, while those of the heat-killed algae treatment decreased sharply from 10.0 to 2.71 μg L− 1in one day and kept constantly after that. The in situ monitoring and visualizing using laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) confirmed the accumulation of phenanthrene in U. prolifera. The increase in nutrient and temperature led to the increase of phenanthrene removal rate, while the salinity had less influence on the removal of phenanthrene. The removal efficiency by U. prolifera had a good linear relationship with phenanthrene initial concentration (r2= 0.999) even at 100 μg L− 1which was higher than its environmentally relevant concentrations. High removal efficiency (91.3%) was observed when the initial phenanthrene concentration was set at environmental relevant concentration (5 μg L− 1). Results of this study demonstrate a potential new natural attenuation process for typical PAHs in coastal water during the outbreak of green tide.

This has lead to treatment failure and high rate of incompliance. Mouth dissolving tablet dosage forms are developed to overcome dysphagia. This study aims to develop mouth dissolving dexamethasone tablets which are able to disintegrate and dissolve rapidly in saliva without the need of water. MDTs of dexamethasone were prepared by using natural and synthetic superdisintegrants at different concentration. Direct compression technique was used to develop the tablets. The prepared tablets were evaluated with various physiochemical parameters like thickness, hardness, friability, weight variation, wetting time, water absorption ratio, disintegration time, in vitro dispersion time and in vitro dissolution. Drug release kinetics was also studied.The prepared mouth dissolving dexamethasone tablets were found to be better in term of more rapid drug release as compared to current marketed dexamethasone tablets. Drug is releasing from tablets following first order kinetics and Fickian diffusion.

Ni was incorporated by the impregnation method. The supports were previously activated by using a thermo-chemical protocol consisting on a severe reduction (H2/Ar) at 950 °C followed by a mild oxidation (O2/He) at 500 °C. According to TPR results, this protocol leads to the development of unique redox properties in the case of the CeO2/YSZ oxide. Two types of CO2+ CH4(1:1) mixtures (helium-diluted and undiluted) were used to feed the reactor. When using the Ni/Ce0.15Zr0.85O2catalyst with undiluted feed, the reactor became plugged by coke. By contrast, Ni/CeO2/YSZ behaved as an active and stable catalyst even under the most severe operation conditions. The characterization of the spent Ni/CeO2/YSZ using TGA, TEM, Raman and XPS spectroscopy revealed that only a limited amount of graphitic carbon, in form of nanotubes, was formed. No evidences of deactivating carbonaceous forms were obtained. The singular redox properties of the activated CeO2/YSZ oxides are proposed as a key for designing Ni catalysts highly stable in reforming processes.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Departamento de Ciencia de los Materiales e Ingeniería Metalúrgica y Química Inorgánica\Campus Río San Pedro s/n\Spain; Departamento de Física de la Materia Condensada\Campus Río San Pedro s/n\Spain; IMEYMAT\Instituto de Microscopía Electrónica y Materiales\Spain,-,Ceria; Dry reforming; Methane; Nickel; YSZ

It is main use is to decrease iron overload in patients who are receiving blood transfusions for a long time in conditions such as beta-thalassemia and other chronic anemias. This study was aimed to determine the benefit of the oral chelating agent (Deferasirox) and it is a side effect in thalassemia patients. Fifty patients with a provisional diagnosis of thalassemia major and transfusional iron in Aldiwaniya province/Iraq in the period (August 2015 -April 2017). Most of the patients were managed according to the own protocol with the target hemoglobin levels around 9.5-10.5 mg/dl before blood transfusion. Serum ferritin estimation was advised after at least ten packed red cell transfusions. The oral chelating was started to inform of deferasirox oral tablet in doses of 10 to 20 mg per kg per day if ferritin levels in serum reached > 1000 ng per ml and 20-40mg/kg if serum ferritin more than 1500ng/ml. Those patients were switched to deferasirox, as an oral chelating agent without used any other chelator. The patients were classified based on the age groups (less than and above 10 years) and according to gender. The average level of ferritin in the serum of these group at the initiation of the study was 2678.83 ng/ml before treatment and 2255.43ng/ml after deferasirox commenced. The study group recorded a good compliance in 70% and poor in 30%. Patients treated with deferasirox showed some gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea in 12% of cases and skin rash in 2% and increase in a liver enzyme in 4%. Deferasirox is well affordable with long-term treatment and the adverse effects are minimal with this medication; therefore optimum treatment is needed to produce the good clinical result and decrease or no adverse effects in a good acceptable dose; however the occurrence of therapy-related adverse effect decreases with time and the common therapeutic complications reported are related to gastrointestinal symptoms and skin rash in some patients and increase in liver enzyme. The availability of this therapy (oral iron chelators), like deferasirox, may take part to produce good satisfaction, especially among young child and school-age patients in which the compliance is a very big problem. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation.",Abd Abdulaziz Wannas; Al-Obaidi Jamah Nasir; Meshay Hasan Dede,Department of Pediatrics\College of Medicine\Iraq; Maternity and Children Teaching Hospital\Al-Qadisiyah\Iraq,-,Deferasirox; Ferritin; Oral chelating agent

In this context, we have analyzed a contemporary series of octogenarians undergoing mitral valve surgery at our institution. Material/Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 138 consecutive octogenarians receiving mitral valve surgery between January 2006 and April 2017. Preoperative comorbidities, early mortality, postoperative clinical course, and predictors of mortality were examined. Results: The mean age was 82.4±2.0 years and 50% (n=69) were male. Preoperative comorbidities included history of heart infarction (24.6%, n=34), chronic renal failure (37.7%, n=52), and COPD (27.5%, n=38). A total of 52.9% (n=73) had a history of previous cardiac decompensation, while 20 (14.5%) presented with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. In all, 33 patients (23.9%) underwent emergency surgery. There were only 39 isolated mitral valve procedures, while 99 patients (71.7%) underwent various concomitant procedures. The intensive care unit average length of stay was 5.3±7.5 days. Respiratory complications and sepsis were the most frequent postoperative complications. Emergency surgery and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting were the most important predictors of early mortality. The overall 30-day mortality was 18.1% (n=25). The mean follow-up time was 1.7±2.3 years. Conclusions: Octogenarians are increasingly represented in cardiac surgery and combined procedures.

1098.html,The effects of heuristics and apophenia on probabilistic choice,"Given a repeated choice between two or more options with independent and identically distributed reward probabilities, overall pay-offs can be maximized by the exclusive selection of the option with the greatest likelihood of reward. The tendency to match response proportions to reward contingencies is suboptimal. nevertheless, this behaviour is well documented. A number of explanatory accounts have been proposed for probability matching. These include failed pattern matching, driven by apophenia, and a heuristic-driven response that can be overruled with sufficient deliberation. We report two experiments that were designed to test the relative effects on choice behaviour of both an intuitive versus strategic approach to the task and belief that there was a predictable pattern in the reward sequence, through a combination of both direct experimental manipulation and post-experimental self-report. Mediation analysis was used to model the pathways of effects. Neither of two attempted experimental manipulations of apophenia, nor self-reported levels of apophenia, had a significant effect on proportions of maximizing choices. However, the use of strategy over intuition proved a consistent predictor of maximizing, across all experimental conditions. A parallel analysis was conducted to assess the effect of controlling for individual variance in perceptions of reward contingencies. Although this analysis suggested that apophenia did increase probability matching in the standard task preparation, this effect was found to result from an unforeseen relationship between self-reported apophenia and perceived reward probabilities. A Win-stay Lose-shift (WSLS) analysis indicated no reliable relationship between WSLS and either intuition or strategy use.",Ellerby Zack W.; Tunney Richard J.,School of Psychology\University of Nottingham\United Kingdom,-,Apophenia; Heuristics; Judgement under uncertainty; Probability matching

Material/Methods: A total of 181 patients underwent surgery because of suspected cardiac tumor in our institution between 1998 and 2016. In 162 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed postoperatively and these patients were included in this study. Preoperative baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative early and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Results: Mean age at presentation was 56.6±17.6 years, and 95 (58.6%) patients were female. There were 126 (77.8%) patients with benign cardiac tumors, while the remaining patients had malignant tumors (primary and metas-tasized). The mean follow-up time was 5.2±4.7 years. The most frequent histologically verified tumor type was myxoma (63%, n=102). In terms of malignant tumors, various types of sarcomas presented most primary malignant cardiac tumors (7.4%, n=12). The mean ICU length of stay was 1.7±2.2 days and overall in-hospital mortality was 3.1% (n=5). Frequent postoperative complications included mediastinal bleeding (5.8%, n=9), wound infection (1.3%, n=2), acute renal failure (5.6%, n=9), and major cerebrovascular events (n=7, 4.6%). The overall cumulative survival after cardiac tumor resection was 94% at 30 days, 85% at 1 year, 72% at 5 years, and 59% at 15 years.

Yet, it does not take into account the ability of individual countries to drive growth process in other economies. Money spent to boost domestic credit provisioning in growth pole-like economies is more likely to spill over to other adjoined economies and help them to recover, even in the presence of depressed domestic demand and/or overleveraged domestic banking sector. Purpose of the article: This paper reports growth pole scores for 19 euro area countries, and compares it to the official distribution key used to transmit newly created source of funding. Methods: We modify the procedure developed in World Bank (2011) for growth pole computation in order to account for strength of linkages connecting member states. Findings & Value added: Our results suggest that the official distribution key might not be completely optimal once looking at the growth pole scores. Countries small in economic size (Baltic states, Slovakia and Slovenia) would benefit from a more differentiated distribution, as they strongly outperform their benchmark set by the official distribution key. On theother hand, big euro area economies do not achieve the levels used in official distribution key, taking into account their growth pole potential for other euro area economies. © Institute of Economic Research.",Kotlebova Jana; Siranova Maria,University of Economics in Bratislava\Dolnozemska cesta 1\Slovakia,-,Growth pole; Network analysis; Unconventional monetary policy

The vertex set of this graph is Z2and two vertices are connected by an edge if the Euclidean distance between these vertices is one. Ben-Haim & Litsyn have proved that the minimum density of identifying code in the infinite square grid is [formula presented]. Such codes are called optimal. We study the number of completely different optimal identifying codes in the infinite square grid. Two codes are called completely different if there exists an integer n such that no n×n-square of one code is equivalent with any n×n-square of the other code. In particular, we show that there are exactly two completely different optimal periodic codes and no optimal identifying code is completely different with both of these two periodic codes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pelto Mikko,University of Turku\Turku\Finland,-,Density; Difference; Discrete geometry; Identifying code; Lattice

How can these discrepant results be reconciled? To answer this question, we used a change-detection paradigm to test visual working memory performance for multiple real-world objects. We found that working memory for moderate similarity items was worse than that for either high or low similarity items. This pattern was unaffected by manipulations of stimulus type (faces vs. scenes), encoding duration (limited vs. self-paced), and presentation format (simultaneous vs. sequential). We also found that the similarity effects differed in strength in different categories (scenes vs. faces). These results suggest that complex real-world objects are represented using a centre-surround inhibition organization. These results support the category-specific cortical resource theory and further suggest that centre-surround inhibition organization may differ by category.",Yang Li; Mo Lei,Centre for Studies of Psychological Application\South China Normal University\China; School of Psychology\South China Normal University\China; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science\South China Normal University\China,-,Centre-surround inhibition format; Change-detection task; Real-world stimuli; Similarity; Visual working memory (VWM)

Korean uses a different word (i.e., netha) for loose-fits (e.g., apple in bowl). We tested whether these differences influence the attention of the speaker. In a crosslinguistic study, we compared native German speakers with native Korean speakers. Participants rated the similarity of two successive video clips of several scenes where two objects were joined or nested (either in a tight or loose manner). The rating data show that Korean speakers base their rating of similarity more on tight-versus loose-fit, whereas German speakers base their rating more on containment versus support (in vs. auf). Throughout the experiment, we also measured the participants' eye movements. Korean speakers looked equally long at the moving Figure object and at the stationary Ground object, whereas German speakers were more biased to look at the Ground object. Additionally, Korean speakers also looked more at the region where the two objects touched than did German speakers.

Vascular pathology occurs immediately after SCI and continues throughout the acute injury phase. In fact, endothelial cells appear to be the first to die after a contusive SCI. The early vascular events, including increased permeability of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), induce vasogenic edema and contribute to detrimental secondary injury events caused by complex injury mechanisms. Targeting the vascular disruption, therefore, could be a key strategy to reduce secondary injury cascades that contribute to histological and functional impairments after SCI. Previous studies were mostly performed on postmortem samples and were unable to capture the dynamic changes of the vascular network. In this study, we have developed an in vivo duo-color two-photon imaging method to monitor acute vascular dynamic changes following contusive SCI. This approach allows detecting blood flow, vessel diameter, and other vascular pathologies at various sites of the same rat pre- and post-injury. Overall, this method provides an excellent venue for investigating vascular dynamics. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Prior research has shown that children are susceptible to Rl when the to-be-remembered and interfering information are similar, but it is unclear whether they are also vulnerable to nonspecific Rl. This form of interference occurs when a memory is disrupted by an unrelated and dissimilar distractor task, and the present study explored six- and seven-yearolds susceptibility to such nonspecific Rl. In two experiments, participants learnt a list of words and completed a free recall test 5 min later. During the interval, participants either remained quiet (the control condition) or completed spot-the-difference puzzles (the interference condition). In Experiment 1, the children were highly susceptible to nonspecific interference, whereas a sample of adults were not affected by the interfering task. However, when a new sample of children were given more time to encode and retrieve the words in Experiment 2, they were able to resist interference. Nonspecific Rl can damage children's memory, but they do have the ability to prevent this form of interference in certain circumstances.",Fútanla Jilien; Mercer Tom,University College\London\United Kingdom; University of Wolverhampton\Millennium City\United Kingdom,-,Forgetting; Memory development; Nonspecific interference; Retroactive interference
1104.html,"Different paths to different strategies? Unique associations among facets of the Dark Triad, empathy, and trait emotional intelligence","Emotional deficits, such as limited empathy, are considered a fundamental aspect of the Dark Triad traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). however, the nature and extent of such deficiencies seem to vary among dark personalities. By applying multidimensional measures of empathy, emotional intelligence, and the Dark Triad, we aimed to investigate in more detail how individuals high in various dark traits understand and evaluate emotions. Results indicated that each trait, and, moreover, each facet thereof entailed unique emotional deficiencies. Narcissism was positively associated with trait emotional intelligence, whereas the secondary factor of psychopathy was associated negatively. With respect to empathy, only primary psychopathy was linked to an overall deficit, while a positive relationship was found between Machiavellianism and the perspective-taking facet of cognitive empathy. We argue that the specific emotional limitations of the Dark Triad traits might contribute to the successful deployment of different socially aversive strategies.",Szabó Edit; Bereczkei Tamás,Institute of Psychology\University of Pécs\Hungary,-,Dark Triad; Emotional intelligence; Empathy

Although research related to active aging has gained considerable interest in Malaysia, older adults’ active aging is still in its infancy. The crucial role of neighborhood characteristics as promoting active aging has led the WHO to adopt more comprehensive approaches by introducing ‘Age-Friendly Cities’ program. This study used a qualitative approach to explore the experience of older adults’ active aging as influenced by neighborhood characteristics. The data explication centered on concept of active aging. Main themes emerged were: physical activity, facilitators to physical activity, and barriers to physical activity, accessibility, social interaction, and safely. The results show that older adults are sensitive with respect to perceived falling hazards due to poor lighting and poor walkway conditions. Regular maintenance is required to avoid restrictions upon their physical activity. © 2017, University of Malaya.

Knowledge of biofilm composition leads to a better understanding of cariogenic and periopathogenic mechanisms. Microbial changes taking place in the oral cavity during childhood are of interest for several reasons. The evolution of the child oral microbiota and shifts in its composition need to be analyzed further to understand and possibly prevent the onset of disease. At the same time, advanced knowledge of the natural composition of oral biofilm is needed. Early stages of caries-free permanent dentition with healthy gums provide a widely unaffected subgingival habitat that can serve as an in situ baseline for studying features of oral health and disease. Analysis of children’s oral biofilm during different stages in life is thus an important theme in the field. Modern molecular analysis methods can provide comprehensive information about the bacterial diversity of such biofilms. To enable microbiota data comparison, it is important to standardize each step in the procedure for molecular data generation. This procedure spans from clinical sampling, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), bioinformatic data processing, to taxonomic interpretation. One of the most critical factors here is biofilm sampling. Sampling in children is even more challenging in particular due to limited space in subgingival areas. We thus focus on the use of paper points for subgingival sampling.

However, most building occupants are not normally aware of the importance of the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). Good IEQ specifically for educational oriented environment should be focused on as it affects students’ learning performance. Therefore, two methods have been specifically selected for this research. One is classroom environment intervention and the other is by classroom measurement set up. In both conditions, the sampling devices were placed for 2 weeks in certain selected locations to see any clianges on environment in the classroom. Measurement of thermal comfort and indoor air quality were recorded and at the same time questionnaires were distributed among the students in order to identify their satisfaction. Results for the measurement in normal condition show that the level of VOC was high (11.7ppm).

In this work, 2D layered composite coupling (001) facet of BiOCl nanoplates and (002) facet of C3N4nanosheets was reasonable designed and successful constructed. In comparison with pure C3N4, the BiOCl/C3N4hybrid structure with loading of 70% BiOCl exhibits the highest methyl orange photodegradation performance although BiOCl/C3N4hybrid photocatalyst harvest less visible light. Obviously, enhanced photocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to large contact surface of 2D layered hybrid structure, which is favorable for the interface electrons transfer and the separation of carriers between C3N4and BiOCl. A probable degradation mechanism based on trapping experiments of active species, transient photocurrents, photoluminescence spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and energy band structures is proposed. This work may provide a further insight into the rational construction composites with large interface contact for high-efficiency light utilization.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Wenwen; Qiao Lulu; Zhu Anquan; Liu Yi; Pan Jun,State Key Laboratory for Powder Metallurgy\Central South University\China,-,2D layered composite; BiOCl/C3N4photocatalyst; Interface contact; MO degradation; Photocatalytic activity; Visible light

Municipal records from certain regions indicate that local officials were confronted with disturbances caused by the scold, and royal ordinances outlined the jurisdiction for sentencing scolds. At both levels of government, the scold was persistently depicted as female. Moreover, a few elite male writers highlighted the problem with the quarrelsome woman, and offered their misogynist solutions to this perceived problem.

Under the democratic regime set up after 1974, Calvet was able to build for himself the reputation of being one of the 'founding fathers' of the Europeanist currents who, working discreetly inside the authoritarian state, made sure that Portugal took part in some of the critical stages of the European integration process. So successful was he in projecting this image that other facets that may add some complexity to his trajectory are usually neglected (his involvement in key late colonial dossiers). This article will address such apparent ambivalence and make sense of the ideas and praxis of someone who while trying to remain true to his own vision of Portugal's national interest, had to serve an embattled regime that led the country to a diplomatic dead end since 1961.",Oliveira Pedro Aires,IHC\NOVA FCSH\Portugal,-,China; Diplomacy; Estado Novo; European integration; Foreign policy; Portugal
1112.html,"Feminist strategy in international law: Understanding its legal, normative and political dimensions","While international law has typically waxed and waned in feminist favours, contemporary feminist engagements reveal a strongly critical, reflective thrust about the costs of engaging international law and the quality of ostensible gains. To inform this reflection, this article draws on feminist scholarship in international law-and a specific feminist campaign for the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security in Northern Ireland-to distil three distinct feminist understandings of international law that underpin both theory and advocacy. International law is understood, first, as a system of rules to which states are bound; second, as an avenue for the articulation of shared feminist values; and, third, as a political tool to advance feminist demands. The study finds that feminist doctrinalists, and those working within the institutions of international law, share concerns about the resolution's legal deficiencies and the broader place of the Security Council within international law-making. These concerns, however, are largely remote for local feminist activists, who recognize in the resolution important political resources to support their mobilization, their alliances with others and, ultimately, it is hoped, their engagement with state actors. The article concludes that critical reflection on feminist strategy in international law is usefully informed by more deliberate consideration of its legal, political and normative dimensions as well as by an awareness that these dimensions will be differently weighted by differently situated feminist actors. © The Author(s), 2018.

We take websites to be key sources of textual data that can provide insights into the discourses surrounding the field of engineering. We ask whether women-only institutions (WOIs) frame engineering in ways that appeal more broadly to women. Our sample comprises the full range of WOIs offering engineering degrees in the US (14) and a comparison sample of 14 coeducational universities also offering engineering degrees. We employ established methods for discourse analysis, and both deductive and inductive coding processes in analyzing the textual data. Our main findings indicate that WOIs' framing of engineering places a greater emphasis on collaboration, supports for students, interdisciplinarity, and the potential for engineering to contribute to improvements for society. In contrast, co-ed institutions tend to place a greater emphasis on the financial returns and job security that result from majoring in engineering. We conclude that co-ed engineering programs should consider a broadening of the descriptions surrounding the engineering field, since the inclusion of a wider set of values could be appealing to women students. © 2017 by the author.",da Costa Romina B.; Stromquist Nelly P.,International Education Policy Program\College of Education\United States,-,Coeducational institutions; Discourse analysis; Engineering; Framing; Gender; Higher education; Major selection; Program selection; STEM; Women-only institutions
112.html,In vivo isotopic fractionation of zinc and biodynamic modeling yield insights into detoxification mechanisms in the mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer,"Diversity and biomass of aquatic insects decline in metal-rich aquatic environments, but the mechanisms by which insects from such environments cope with potentially toxic metal concentrations to survive through adulthood are less well understood. In this study, we measured Zn concentrations and isotopes in laboratory-reared diatoms and mayflies (Neocloeon triangulifer) from larval through adult stages. The larvae were fed Zn-enriched diatoms, and bio-concentrated Zn by a factor of 2.5–5 relative to the diatoms but maintained the same Zn-isotopic ratio. These results reflect the importance of dietary uptake and the greater rate of uptake relative to excretion or growth. Upon metamorphosis to subimago, Zn concentrations declined by > 70%, but isotopically heavy Zn remained in the subimago bodies. We surmised that the loss of isotopically light Zn during metamorphosis was due to the loss of detoxified Zn and retention of metabolically useful Zn. Through the transition from subimago to imago, Zn concentrations and isotope ratios were virtually unchanged. Because the decrease in Zn body concentration and increase in heavier Zn are seen in the subimagos relative to the larvae, the compartmentalization of Zn must be occurring within the larvae. A biodynamic model was constructed, allowing for isotopic fractionation and partitioning of Zn between metabolically essential and detoxified Zn reservoirs within larvae. The model provides a consistent set of rate and fractionation constants that successfully describe the experimental observations. Specifically, metabolically essential Zn is isotopically heavier and is tightly held once assimilated, and excess, isotopically light Zn is sequestered, detoxified, and ultimately lost during the metamorphosis of larvae to subimagos. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of in vivo isotopic fractionation in insects, offering an improved understanding of the mechanisms and rates by which the N. triangulifer larvae regulate excess Zn in their bodies. © 2017",Wanty Richard B.; Balistrieri Laurie S.; Wesner Jeff S.; Walters David M.; Schmidt Travis S.; Stricker Craig A.; Kraus Johanna M.; Wolf Ruth E.,U.S. Geological Survey\MS 963 Denver Federal Center\United States; U.S. Geological Survey\School of Oceanography\United States; Department of Biology\University of South Dakota\United States; U.S. Geological Survey\Fort Collins Science Center\United States,-,biodynamic model; fractionation; Neocloeon triangulifer; toxicity; Zinc isotopes

The numerical simulations are carried out to solve the system using Euler method for its simplicity, and then the PFC method is applied to the discretized system. The controlled trajectory converges to an unstable equilibrium point via small control action. The stability analysis is shown compared to that of the continuous system in details. Also the choice of the controlling input of the PFC method and its properties are discussed. Lorenz system and Rössler system are the well known chosen chaotic examples. The PFC method is applied to each of them, showing stability at each of their equilibrium point.

As a base for our simulation system we have used a combination of a base native layer implemented using C++ language which uses MPI library, and Microsoft.NET platform as an environment for model code written in high-level C# programming language. To perform a load balancing of agents between processes the METIS/ParMETIS algorithms were used. These algorithms allow to split the graph of agents and links into parts of similar size with the least possible number of links between them.

And the sufficient conditions for the extinction and the persistence of the stochastic epidemic model with temporary immunity are derived by constructing Lyapunov functions and the generalized Ito’s formula, where the threshold of the persistence does not depend on the temporary immunity, while the densities of the infected and recovered are obviously dependent on the temporary immunity when given a perturbation.

1126.html,Thermoelectric Performance of Na-Doped GeSe,"Recently, hole-doped GeSe materials have been predicted to exhibit extraordinary thermoelectric performance owing largely to extremely low thermal conductivity. However, experimental research on the thermoelectric properties of GeSe has received less attention. Here, we have synthesized polycrystalline Na-doped GeSe compounds, characterized their crystal structure, and measured their thermoelectric properties. The Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing Na content up to x = 0.01 due to an increase in the hole carrier concentration and remains roughly constant at higher concentrations of Na, consistent with the electrical resistivity variation. However, the electrical resistivity is large for all samples, leading to low power factors. Powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectrometry results show the presence of a ternary impurity phase within the GeSe matrix for all doped samples, which suggests that the optimal carrier concentration cannot be reached by doping with Na. Nevertheless, the lattice thermal conductivity and carrier mobility of GeSe is similar to those of polycrystalline samples of the leading thermoelectric material SnSe, leading to quality factors of comparable magnitude. This implies that GeSe shows promise as a thermoelectric material if a more suitable dopant can be found. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Shaabani Laaya; Aminorroaya-Yamini Sima; Byrnes Jacob; Akbar Nezhad Ali; Blake Graeme R.,Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials\University of Groningen\Netherlands; Australian Institute for Innovative Materials\Innovation Campus\Australia; Department of Engineering and Mathematics\Sheffield Hallam University\United Kingdom; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering\University of New South Wales\Australia,-,-

The anodizing conditions such as electrolyte composition and applied potential were optimized. In order to examine the influence of electrolyte stirring and applied magnetic field, the anodic samples were prepared under the dynamic and static conditions in the presence or absence of magnetic field. It was shown that ordered iron oxide nanopore arrays could be obtained at lower anodizing temperatures (10 and 20 °C) at the static conditions without the magnetic field or at the dynamic conditions with the applied magnetic field. Since the as-prepared anodic layers are amorphous in nature, the samples were annealed in air at different temperatures (200–500 °C) for a fixed duration of time (1 h). The morphology and crystal phases developed after anodization and subsequent annealing were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. The results proved that the annealing process transforms the amorphous layer into magnetite and hematite phases. In addition, the heat treatment results in a substantial decrease in the fluorine content and increase in the oxygen content.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pawlik Anna; Hnida Katarzyna; Socha Robert P.; Wiercigroch Ewelina; Małek Kamilla; Sulka Grzegorz D.,Department of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry\Faculty of Chemistry\Poland; Academic Centre for Materials and Nanotechnology\AGH University of Science and Technology\Poland; Jerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry\Polish Academy of Sciences\Poland; Faculty of Chemistry\Jagiellonian University in Krakow\Poland,-,Annealing; Anodization; Hematite; Iron oxides; Magnetic field; Magnetite

We developed a model by considering emissions caps, economic growth, inter-sector linkage, and the smoothness of industrial structure change comprehensively. The model is applied to the Zhejiang Province, a typical Chinese coastal area that has high level of industrialization but severe environmental issues. By integrating multi-criteria decision analysis, input-output table, and scenario analysis, the model uncovers key sectors with relatively high sensitivity to the reallocation of emission caps, and reasonable solutions for emission caps reallocation among all industries are proposed. The results also indicate the spillover of pollutant emissions will be a crucial issue for some industries. The uncertainty in the model is quantified using a Monte Carlo simulation and the results indicate that industrial re-structuring, economic targets, and emission intensity were the most decisive factors to fulfill the emission caps control in the Zhejiang Province. The sensitivity analysis results implied that the key sectors which need to be significantly adjusted on emissions quotas remain the same in most cases. Finally, the policy implications of the study are explored. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Guo Yang; Zeng Zizhang; Tian Jinping; Xu Feng; Chen Lujun; Zhou Anguo,School of Environment\Tsinghua University\China; School of Economics and Management\Beijing University of Chemical Technology\China; Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Water Science and Technology\Department of Environment\China; Academy of Environmental Research and Design of Zhejiang Province\#111 Tianmushan Road\China,-,China; Emission quota reallocation model; Emission reduction; Green development; Industrial structure optimization

The consequences of growth time (1 h–4 h) on the structural and optical properties of the aligned ZnO (NRs) were investigated through X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and photoluminescence (PL) analyses. The results show that the ZnO (NRs) were preferred to grew aligned along the c-axis as hexagonal wurtzite structure as proved by the sharp and strong ZnO (002) peaks of the ZnO (NRs). Irrespective of the growth continuation, FESEM photos confirmed that the ZnO nanorods arrays were fit to be aligned along the c-axis and perpendicular to (PTFE) substrates. The ZnO nanorods that exhibited the sharper stand most intense PL peaks among the sample were grown for 3hs as demonstrated by PL spectra. The device further showed a sensitivity of 4068 to low-power (1.25 mW/cm2) 375 nm light pulses without an external bias. The measurements of photoresponse demonstrated the highly reproducible characteristics of the fabricated UV detector with rapid response and baseline recovery times of 48.05 ms. Thus, this work introduced a simple, low-cost method of fabricating rapid-response, and highly photosensitive UV detectors with zero power consumption on Teflon substrates.                          © 2017",Ahmed Naser M.; Oglat Ammar A.,Nano-Optoelectronics Research and Technology Laboratory\School of Physics\Malaysia; College of Arts and Sciences\Alasmarya Islamic University – Zliten\Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Department of Physics\College of Science\Bahrain; Department of Physics\Faculty of Education\Yemen,-,CBD; FESEM; Phtodetector; Teflon; Time; ZnO nanorods
117.html,"Identifying priority management intervals of discharge and TN/TP concentration with copula analysis for Miyun Reservoir inflows, North China","The quantitative environmental management of reservoir inflows is challenging due to complex coexistence relationships between water quantity and water quality variables. Taking discharge as a representative water quantity indicator, as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) as water quality indicators for the twin rivers (i.e., the Chaohe and Baihe rivers) which run into the Miyun Reservoir in North China, this study calculated marginal probability distributions of these indicators, and analyzed the joint probability distribution of discharge and TN/TP concentration by applying the Frank copula function. According to an analysis of various scenario combinations of discharge and TN/TP concentration, the quantitative management intervals including the priority control interval, the key attention interval and the daily maintenance interval, were identified. The results were as follows: (a) a fitting degree evaluation indicated that the Pearson-III distribution for the marginal probability distribution of discharge and the lognormal distribution for that of TN/TP concentration were feasible. Additionally, the Frank copula theory was applicable for their joint probability analysis according to the applicability analysis and goodness-of-fit test; (b) regarding to the water quality of the Miyun Reservoir inflows, it is more important to enhance the control of the Chaohe River and the monitoring of TP concentration; and (c) the TN concentration within division values of discharge (i.e., 16.59, 24.14 m3/s) was tend to exceed the class III limitation of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water in China, and the concentrations of TN and TP increased as the discharge increased for the two rivers. The quantitative management intervals based on copula analysis is an intuitive and effective solution for comprehensive risk management of reservoir inflows. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Xuan; Zang Nan; Liang Peiyu; Cai Yanpeng; Li Chunhui; Yang Zhifeng,State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation\Beijing Normal University\China; Key Laboratory for Water and Sediment Sciences of Ministry of Education\Beijing Normal University\China; IER Environmental Protection Engineering Technique Co.\Ltd.\China; Beijing Engineering Research Center for Watershed Environmental Restoration & Integrated Ecological Regulation\Beijing\China,-,Copula analysis; Joint probabilities of discharge and TN/TP concentration; Priority management intervals; Reservoir inflows; Twin river system

The catalytic property of the Cu2O, Cu2O/SnO2, Cu2O/Pd/SnO2, Cu2O/Pd, Cu2O/CuO/Pd, CuO/SnO2/Pd, CuO, and commercial catalyst for dimethyldichlorosilane synthesis via the Rochow reaction was investigated. As compared to control samples and commercial catalyst, the prepared CuO/Pd/SnO2hollow microboxes exhibited much higher silicon conversion (76.6%), which is related to the synergistic effect between CuO, Pd and SnO2, and to the distinct catalyst hollow structure which allows the efficient transportation of the reactant molecules to the active component.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gao Junjie; Zhang Zailei; An Xuebin; Zhang Yi,The National Engineering Laboratory for Hydrometallurgical Cleaner Production Technology\Institute of Process Engineering\China; Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems\Chinese Academy of Sciences\China; National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST)\Beijing\China,-,CuO; Hollow; Palladium; SnO2
119.html,Gypsum in animal slurry systems enhances generation of hydrogen sulphide and increases occupational exposure hazard,"Hydrogen sulphide gas (H2S) produced by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) in stored animal slurry is highly toxic and, if emitted into poorly ventilated confined spaces, can build up to concentrations capable of causing asphyxiation. Therefore it is important to understand factors influencing H2S emission from slurry. Powdered gypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate) may be used as animal bedding and, if it enters slurry systems, could be metabolised by SRB and further increase H2S generation. Cattle slurry and cattle bedding collected from farms was used in laboratory-scale experiments sealed in 20 litre vessels fitted with mechanical stirrers. H2S was monitored in head space above the slurry using real-time gas detectors before and after stirring, and before and after adding 1% of two sources of gypsum powder. In one set of experiments, gypsum was already present in the slurry having been used in bedding on the farm. H2S monitoring continued daily for up to 25 days. Before stirring, H2S levels in head spaces were minimal. After stirring, even without gypsum, maximum head space H2S levels with slurry or bedding ranged from 330 to 1190 ppm. By comparison, the UK short-term (15 min) Workplace Exposure Limit is 10 ppm. Statistically significant increases in H2S levels were associated with gypsum addition, as high as 1772 ppm with slurry and 3940 ppm with bedding. Emissions peaked at around day 15 with slurry and bedding to which gypsum was freshly added, but within 5 days when added to slurry already containing farm-added gypsum. Levels of H2S produced from stirred slurry would constitute a hazard to anyone exposed to it, and adding gypsum further increased emission levels. Therefore, if gypsum residues enter slurry it could increase the risk of H2S accumulation in confined spaces associated with slurry systems. It is important therefore to take this into account in managing risk. © 2017",Crook Brian; Stagg Stephen; Bowry Alison; Frost Gillian,Health and Safety Executive\Buxton\United Kingdom,-,Asphyxiation; Cattle; Gypsum; Hydrated calcium sulphate; Hydrogen sulphide; Slurry

After Möller's Hieratische Paläographie I-III being based on merely 32 sources, Egyptologists compiled several more or less complete palaeographies on single texts, groups of texts or time spans. However, the comparability of signs is often unconvincing or impossible due to the heterogeneity of writing surfaces, the quality of the facsimiles/photos or the choice of examples and details, furthermore the word or sign context is mostly missing. Since April 2015, a new long-term project for a possible maximum of 23 years has been located at the universities of Mainz and Darmstadt, and financed by the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities. This paper presents the aims and methods of the project: A systematic and digital inventory of hieratic and cursive hieroglyphic characters; a digital palaeography database with various search options and extensive metadata; systematic studies on various topics concerning e.g. emergence, development, contexts, regional use, datability, economy, layout, and identification of individual scribes' hands.

120.html,SBA-15/hydrotalcite nanocomposite as an efficient support for the immobilization of heteropolyacid: A triply-hybrid catalyst for the synthesis of 2-amino-4H-pyrans in water,"To circumvent the high solubility and low surface area of heteropolyacid and in attempt to develop a bi-functional heterogeneous catalyst for promoting organic transformations, heteropolyacid was embedded in functionalized SBA-15 and subsequently hybridized with layered double hydroxide. The catalyst could be considered as a bi-functional catalyst with both acidic and basic properties. The acidic properties emerged from the SBA-15 and heteropolyacid component while layered double hydroxide render the catalyst basic. The catalyst was characterized by using SEM/EDX, FT-IR, XRD, ICP-AES, BET and elemental mapping analysis. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was studied for promoting one-pot three-component condensation of aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate and C-H activated acidic molecules in aqueous media for the synthesis of 2-amino-4H-pyran derivatives. The catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity, which was superior to the previously reported ones. Moreover, the reusability of the catalyst was excellent and the leaching of heteropolyacid was dramatically suppressed. High yields, short reaction times, eco-friendly conditions, simplicity of the procedure, reusability of the catalyst and broad substrate scope are the merits of this protocol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sadjadi Samahe; Heravi Majid M.; Zadsirjan Vahideh; Farzaneh Vahid,Gas Conversion Department\Faculty of Petrochemicals\Iran; Department of Chemistry\School of Science\Iran,-,2-Amino-4H-pyrans; Heteropolyacid; Hydrotalcite; Multi-component reactions; SBA
121.html,High efficient photocatalytic activity from nanostructuralized photonic crystal-like p-n coaxial hetero-junction film photocatalyst of Cu3SnS4/TiO2nanotube arrays,"Structuring the materials in the form of photonic crystals is a new strategy for photocatalytic applications. Herein, a new concept of photonic crystal-induced p-n coaxial heterojunction film photocatalyst of Cu3SnS4/TiO2(CTS/PhC-TNAs) was well-designed and successfully fabricated by combining periodic pulse anodic oxidation and in-situ self-assembling methods Such nanostructured CTS/PhC-TNAs exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic degradation activity under simulated sunlight irradiation with methyl orange (MO) as the target pollutants. Within 120 min, 82% of the MO (10 mg/L) was photodegraded and its kinetic constant per specific surface area reached 0.05332 μmol/m2h, which is 1.6 and 12.8 times more quickly than that of PhC-TNAs and CTS, respectively. Its significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity could be mainly attributed to a joint effect of the unique photonic crystal property of PhC-TNAs and the nanostructured hollow p-n coaxial hetero-junction, which result in an increased efficiency of charge separation and transfer and also an improved spectral response capability. This photonic crystal film photocatalyst has the potential for enhancing the photocatalytic activity via further optimizing the photonic stop band of PhC-TNAs. The study presents a new means to design the kind of photonic crystal structural-induced novel photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activities in pollution treatment.                          © 2017",Li Yan; Liu Fang-Ting; Chang Yin; Wang Jian; Wang Cheng-Wei,Key Laboratory of Atomic and Molecular Physics & Functional Materials of Gansu Province\College of Physics and Electronic Engineering\China,-,Cu3SnS4/TiO2; p-n Coaxial heterojunction; Photocatalytic activity; Photonic crystal

Polymer chain mobility and surface softness have been found to contribute to the protein resistance, but also bring film instability in a liquid protein medium. We investigated the protein resistance ability of three low-Tgpolymers, including hydrophobic polymers polyisoprene (PI), poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA) and hydrophilic polyethylene oxide (PEO), by overcoming the instability issue with crosslinking. We found that the Tgs of PI and PEO can be increased to around 0 °C after crosslinking. The remained strong chain mobility of both films can still resist protein adsorption regardless the hydrophobicity, yet greatly increases the film stability under an aqueous circumstance. The PnBMA film increased its Tgto around room temperature after crosslinking, which deteriorated the protein-resistance ability having the surface covered by BSA molecules. Our results support that the chain mobility of a polymer film plays an important role in resisting protein adsorption due to the increased entropy associated with more mobile polymer chains. By tune the degree of crosslinking, the stability of polymer in aqueous environment can be increased while the protein resistant ability can be remained. Our results provide a new strategy to design polymer materials for effective antifouling.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Jinghui; Huang Zhiwei; Liu Dan,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Wuhan University of Technology\China,-,Antifouling; Crosslinking; Polymer chain mobility; Protein adsorption
123.html,Enhanced uptake of BPA in the presence of nanoplastics can lead to neurotoxic effects in adult zebrafish,"Plastic particles have been proven to be abundant in the aquatic environment, raising concerns about their potential toxic effects. In the present study, we determined the bioaccumulation potential of bisphenol A (BPA) in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of nano-sized plastic particles (nanoplastics, NPPs). Results show that BPA can accumulate in the viscera, gill, head and muscle of zebrafish with 85, 43, 20, and 3 μg/g ww after 1 d exposure. NPPs were also found to accumulate in different tissues of the fish. Relative equilibrium was reached after 1 d exposure in different tissues with 39 to 636 mg/kg ww. Co-exposure of NPPs and BPA led to a 2.2 and 2.6-fold significant increment of BPA uptake in the head and viscera, if compared with BPA alone treatment after 3 d exposure. As such, we further investigated several neurotoxic biomarker alterations in the fish head. It was found that either BPA or NPPs can cause myelin basic protein (MBP)/gene up-regulation in the central nervous system (CNS); meanwhile, both contaminants exhibited significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which is a well-known representative biomarker for neurotoxicity. Moreover, for the co-exposure treatment, biomarkers of myeline and tubulin protein/gene expressions, dopamine content, and the mRNA expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) were all significantly up-regulated, suggesting that an enhanced neurotoxic effects in both CNS and dopaminergic system occurred. However, AChE activity was no more inhibited in the co-exposure treatment, which implies that solely AChE measurement may not be sufficient to identify neurotoxic effects in the cholinergic system. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the presence of NPPs can increase BPA bioavailability and cause neurotoxicity in adult zebrafish. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chen Qiqing; Yin Daqiang; Jia Yunlu; Schiwy Sabrina; Legradi Jessica; Yang Shouye; Hollert Henner,State Key Laboratory of Yangtze River Water Environment\Ministry of Education\China; Institute for Environmental Research\Department of Ecosystem Analysis\Germany; Institute for Environmental Studies\Vrije University Amsterdam\Netherlands; State Key Laboratory of Marine Geology\School of Ocean and Earth Science\China,-,Bioaccumulation; Bisphenol A; Neurotoxicity; Plastic particles
124.html,Fabrication of A/R-TiO2composite for enhanced photoelectrochemical performance: Solar hydrogen generation and dye degradation,"Anatase/rutile TiO2nanorods composites were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method followed by dip coating method using titanium isopropoxide in acetic acid and ethanol solvent. The effects of the titanium isopropoxide precursor concentration, on the formation of dip coated anatase/rutile TiO2nanorods composite were systematically explored. The growth of anatase on rutile TiO2nanorods can be controlled by varying the titanium isopropoxide concentration. The morphological study reveals that anatase TiO2nanograins formed on the surface of rutile TiO2nanorod arrays through dip coating method. Photoelectrochemical analyses showed that the enhancement of the photocatalytic activities of the samples is affected by the anatase nanograins present on the rutile TiO2nanorods, which can induce the separation of electrons and holes. To interpret the photoelectrochemical behaviors, the prepared photoelectrodes were applied in photoelectrochemical solar hydrogen generation and orange II dye degradation. The optimized photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2and the 625 μmol hydrogen generation was observed for 10 mM anatase/rutile TiO2NRs composites. Additionally, 96% removal of the orange II dye was achieved within 5 h during oxidative degradation under solar light irradiation. One of the benefits of high specific surface area and the efficient photogenerated charge transport in the anatase/rutile TiO2nanorod composite improves the photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation and orange dye degradation compared to the rutile TiO2. Thus, our strategy provides a promising, stable, and low cost alternative to existing photocatalysts and is expected to attract considerable attention for industrial applications.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Mahadik Mahadeo A.; An Gil Woo; David Selvaraj; Choi Sun Hee; Cho Min; Jang Jum Suk,Division of Biotechnology\Safety\South Korea; Pohang Accelerator Laboratory\Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)\South Korea,-,Anatase nanograin; Composite; Degradation; Rutile TiO2nanorod; Solar hydrogen generation

The PMOXA-based coatings on the surfaces of glass, silicon, gold and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates were then produced by short-time ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of PMOXA-r-4VP. Water contact angel (WCA), ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ζ-potential techniques were used to characterize the coatings. The results showed that copolymers can be successfully bonded on the surfaces of glass, silicon, gold, and PDMS substrate. Besides, the PMOXA-based coatings displayed a superior resistance to bovine serum albumin, human blood platelets, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells adsorption and good biocompatibility. Finally, stability test indicated that the stability of coatings can be improved with the content of the 4VP segment. Furthermore, PMOXA-r1/2-4VP immobilized surfaces displayed good antifouling property in long-term applications.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhu Haikun; Mumtaz Fatima; Zhang Chong; Tan Lin; Liu Songtao; Zhang Yalin; Pan Chao; Wang Yanmei,CAS Key Laboratory of Soft Matter Chemistry\Department of Polymer Science and Engineering\China,-,Antifouling coating; Poly[(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-random-4-vinylpyridine]; Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization; UV irradiation
126.html,Evolution of wetland in Honghe National Nature Reserve from the view of hydrogeology,"There is wide concern about the evolution of wetlands, an important component of the global ecosystem. The Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR) is an internationally important marsh wetland in China that is at risk of degradation. To gain an improved understanding of how the HNNR wetland developed from 1975 to 2014, typical years, including 1975, 1988, 1996, 2002 and 2014, were selected based on precipitation date. And land cover types of the different years were classified using TM images. The results showed that the wetland evolution mainly reflects transformations between the meadow and wetland land cover types. The landscape index suggests the wetland is degrading. The main drivers of wetland evolution were a warmer and drier climate, the establishment of an irrigation system, and a decrease in the groundwater level. These factors resulted in changes in the quantity of water in the HNNR. We can therefore say that the evolution was driven by changes in the water quantity. Because there have been very few hydrogeological studies in the HNNR, we examined the relationships among precipitation, surface water, and groundwater, all of which significantly influence water quantity. We found that precipitation was the only source of surface water and, while there was certain amount of surface water recharge into the shallow groundwater, the recharge range was limited, which increased the vulnerability of the wetlands. Thus, it is difficult to recharge surface water but easy to lose surface water from the HNNR, which suggests that efforts need to be directed at maintaining the surface water at the optimal level to prevent degradation of the wetland. © 2017",Wu Xiancang; Dong Weihong; Lin Xueyu; Liang Yukai; Meng Ying; Xie Wei,Key Laboratory of Groundwater Resources and Environment\Ministry of Education\China; Geo-mineral Engineering Exploration Institute of Shandong Province\Jinan\China; Institute of Water Resources and Environment\Jilin University\China,-,Driving forces; Hydrogeology; Surface water–groundwater interactions; Wetland evolution

Many of the tunable properties that have made them desirable, such as type, size, charge, or coating, also contribute to the current difficulties in understanding the fate of ENMs in the environment. This review article focuses on studies that investigate plant-ENM interactions, including techniques used to study these interactions and documented plant responses due to the phytotoxic effects of ENMs. The many variables which can be altered for an experiment, such as type, size, and concentration of ENMs, make it difficult to formulate generalizations about the uptake mechanism involved, or to make an inference on the subcellular localization and distribution of the internalized ENMs in plant tissue. In order to avoid these challenges, studies can utilize a model organism such as Arabidopsis thaliana, and a combination of analytical techniques that can reveal complementary information in order to assess how the different experimental conditions influence the uptake and phytotoxicity of ENMs. This review presents recent studies regarding plant-ENM interactions employing Arabidopsis to demonstrate how the use of this model plant can advance our understanding of plant-ENM interactions and guide additional studies using other plant species. Overarching results suggest that more sensitive tests and consistency in experimental designs are needed to fully assess and understand the phytotoxic effects of ENMs in the environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Montes Angelina; Bisson Mary A.; Gardella Joseph A.; Aga Diana S.,Department of Chemistry\University at Buffalo\United States; Department of Biological Sciences\University at Buffalo\United States,-,Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Nanoparticles; Nanotoxicity; Plant imaging; Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry

Here we report black TiO2-xnanoparticles are promising candidate for such an application. Black TiO2-xnanoparticles are synthesized by using cathodic plasma electrolysis, and nanoparticle films are deposited on optical glass plates via natural sedimentation and post annealing. Characterization of the samples with TEM, SEM, XRD and XPS reveal that nanoparticles have diameters of 8–70 nm, and are in polycrystalline structure and co-existence of anatase, rutile and abundant oxygen-deficient phases. Optical transmittance and reflectance measurements with a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer evidence an excellent wide-spectral optical absorption property. The nonlinear optical properties of the samples were measured by using open-aperture Z-scan technique with picosecond 532-nm laser, and verified by direct transmission measurements using nanosecond 1064-nm laser. Strong SA behavior was detected, and the nonlinear absorption coefficient is as high as β = − 4.9 × 10−8m/W, at least two orders larger than most previous reports on ordinary TiO2. The strong SA behaviors are ascribed to the existence of plenty surface states and defect states within bandgap, and the relaxation rates of electrons from upper energy levels to lower ones are much slower than excitation rates.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Rong-Fang; Guo Deng-Zhu; Zhang Geng-Min,Key Laboratory for the Physics and Chemistry of Nanodevices and Department of Electronics\Peking University\China,-,Nanoparticles; Nonlinear optical material; Saturable absorption; Titanium oxide; Z-scan

Undisturbed fen peatlands have been used to minimize the release of contaminants to the aquatic ecosystems; however, there is a limited understanding of wastewater transport or polishing in undisturbed fen peatlands. To elucidate these processes, a small (9800 m2, ~ 250 m long) ladder fen was continuously injected with a wastewater surrogate derived from a custom fertilizer blend and 38 m3day− 1of water for 51 days. The simulated wastewater included sulphate (27.2 mg L− 1), nitrate (7.6 mg L− 1), ammonium (9.1 mg L− 1), phosphate (7.4 mg L− 1), and chloride (47.2 mg L− 1). Major ion, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) pore water concentrations were measured throughout the study period. No wastewater contaminants were detected in the site outlet (~ 250 m down-gradient) and most wastewater contaminants, except for SO42 −and Cl−, remained relatively immobile. Within the SO42 −plume, MeHg and THg concentrations became highly elevated relative to background (up to 10 ng L− 1, ~ three to five-fold increase) and MeHg comprised 60–100% of dissolved THg in the pore water. No MeHg or THg was exported at the outflow. The large increase in THg cannot be solely accounted for by the increase in MeHg and was likely due to enhanced decomposition of the peat substrate by increased microbial activity due to electron acceptor loading. Since the added nutrients were effectively transformed, sequestered or otherwise removed from pore waters in this experimental system, it appears that fen peatlands have a large capacity to safely treat residential wastewater nutrients; however, the inadvertent increases in THg and MeHg require further investigation and potential management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences\University of Waterloo\Canada; Department of Biology\Centre for Environment & Sustainability\Canada; Department of Geography and Environmental Management\University of Waterloo\Canada,-,Mercury; Nitrogen; Peatlands; Phosphate; Sulphate; Wastewater polishing wetland

Numerous magical and medicinal textual sources can be found in both cultures. The Near Eastern cuneiform texts are more descriptive and provide information about the typical location of the illness on the human body and its symptoms and prognosis. The Egyptian sources only report where Sāmānu or Akhu ('h.w), as it is alternatively known in Egypt, could be located; they do not contain any hints about the ailment's appearance and provide only limited information about its prognosis. This paper will offer deeper insight into the medical-magical sources describing the demon as a human disease and will present possible identifications from a modern perspective. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The major constituents of propolis were identified by HPLC. Surface characterization was performed by SEM-EDX and AFM analysis. Experiments were performed as a function of the propolis concentration and immersion time in the corrosive electrolyte. The obtained results showed that propolis presents good anticorrosive properties on bronze, acting as a mixed-type inhibitor, but its protective effectiveness is time-dependent. The highest inhibiting efficiency of 98.9% was obtained in the presence of 100 ppm propolis, after about 12 h of exposure to inhibitor-containing electrolyte through the stabilization of Cu2O on the bronze surface. The inhibitive properties of propolis on bronze corrosion are likely due to the adsorption of its main constituents (flavonoids and phenolic compounds), through the oxygen atoms in their functional groups and aromatic rings, which have been evidenced by FT-IR spectra. The adsorption of propolis on bronze was found to follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Varvara Simona; Bostan Roxana; Bobis Otilia; Găină Luiza; Popa Florin; Mena Vicente; Souto Ricardo M.,Department of Exact Sciences and Engineering\“1 Decembrie 1918” University\Romania; Life Science Institute\Apiculture and Sericiculture Department\Romania; Department of Organic Chemistry\“Babes-Bolyai” University\Romania; Materials Science and Engineering Department\Technical University of Cluj-Napoca\Romania,-,AFM; Bronze corrosion; Electrochemical techniques; Inhibitor; Propolis; SVET
131.html,Insight into the influence of addition of a second metal Fe and supports with different morphology on H2dissociation over Ni/MgO catalysts,"The effect of addition of a second metal to activation component and the support with different morphology on H2dissociation on Ni/MgO catalyst was investigated using density functional theory. The results show that after addition of a second metal Fe, the metal-support interaction is increased in perfect MgO supported Ni catalyst while it is decreased in defective MgO supported Ni catalyst. Although the change is difference between metal-support interaction, the ability of H2dissociation is increased on the two surfaces. Analyzing those results from addition of Fe, Co and Cu to Ni/MgO, one can conclude that it is neither too strong nor too weak (i.e., medium) interaction between metal and support that favors to improve the catalyst performance.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Hongyan; Li Kai; Zhang Riguang; Ling Lixia; Wang Baojun,College of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering\Shanxi Datong University\China; Key Laboratory of Coal Science and Technology of Ministry of Education and Shanxi Province\Taiyuan University of Technology\China; College of Chemical Engineering\Taiyuan University of Technology\China,-,Density-functional theory; H2dissociation; Metal-support interaction; NiFe/MgO
132.html,"Temporal trends of mercury and organohalogen contaminants in great blue heron eggs from the St. Lawrence River, Québec, Canada, 1991–2011, and relationships with tracers of feeding ecology","Since 1991, great blue heron (Ardea herodias) eggs have been collected and analyzed for mercury (Hg), persistent organic contaminants (OCs), brominated and non-brominated flame retardants (FRs) as well as stable isotopes δ13C and δ15N. In the present study, temporal trends of contaminants were analyzed in eggs sampled in four regions along the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) and inland sites using new and previously published data. Most contaminants declined significantly over time in most regions. Globally, the highest annual change, − 17.5%, was found for pp′-DDD, while the smallest annual decline, − 0.54%, was observed for Hg. Concentrations of ΣDDT and ΣFR8(sum of 8 congeners) decreased by − 11.6% and − 7.3%, respectively. Declines in ΣPCBs differed among regions, from − 5.6% in the fluvial section to − 14.7% in the inland region. The highest concentration of ΣFR8was measured in eggs from Grande Ile in the fluvial section of the river in 1996 (2.39 μg/g). Stable isotope ratios also showed temporal trends in some regions: δ13C decreased in the fluvial section and increased in Gulf region, while δ15N decreased in the fluvial section and increased in the upper estuary. Significant positive relationships were found between ΣDDT, ΣPCBs and ΣFRs and δ15N and δ13C in freshwater colonies, but not in estuarine or marine colonies. These results suggest that changes in trophic level and foraging areas over time were influential factors with respect to contaminant burden in great blue heron eggs in the fluvial section, but not in the other regions. © 2017",Champoux Louise; Boily Monique,Environment and Climate Change Canada\Wildlife and Landscape Science Directorate\Canada; Département des Sciences Biologiques\Université du Québec à Montréal\Canada,-,Ardeids; Flame retardants; Persistent contaminants; St. Lawrence River; Stable isotopes
133.html,Improving crystallization and electron mobility of indium tin oxide by carbon dioxide and hydrogen dual-step plasma treatment,"Obtaining high conductivity indium tin oxide (ITO) films simultaneously with a “soft-deposited” (low temperature, low ions bombardment) and cost-efficient deposition process are critical aspect for versatile photo-electronic devices application. Usually, the low-cost “soft-deposited” process could be achieved via evaporation technique, but with scarifying the conductivity of the films. Here, we show a CO2and H2two-step plasma (TSP) post-treatment applied to ITO films prepared by reactive thermal evaporation (RTE), allows to meet the special trade-off between the deposition techniques and the electrical properties. Upon treatment, an increase in electron concentration and electron mobility is observed, which subsequently resulting a low sheet resistivity. The mobility reaches high values of 80.9 cm2/Vs for the TSP treated ∼100 nm thickness samples. From a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and opto-electronic measurements, it demonstrated that: during the TSP process, the first-step CO2plasma treatment could promote the crystallinity of the RTE ITO films. While the electron traps density at grain boundaries of polycrystalline RTE ITO films could be passivated by hydrogen atom during the second-step H2plasma treatment. These results inspired that the TSP treatment process has significant application prospects owing to the outstanding electrical properties enhancement for “soft-deposited” RTE ITO films.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Fengyou; Du Rongchi; Ren Qianshang; Wei Changchun; Zhao Ying; Zhang Xiaodan,Key Laboratory of Functional Materials Physics and Chemistry of the Ministry of Education\Jilin Normal University\China; Institute of Photo Electronics Thin Film Devices and Technology of Nankai University\Key Laboratory of Photoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology\China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin)\Tianjin\China,-,Electron mobility; Indium tin oxide films; Photo-electronic devices; Plasma treatment; Reactive thermal evaporation
134.html,Multivariate and integrative approach to analyze multiple biomarkers in ecotoxicology: A field study in Neotropical region,"Aquatic pollution has dramatically worsened in developing countries, due to the discharge of a mixture of pollutants into water bodies, to the lack of stringent laws, and the inadequate treatment of effluents. In this study, the Neotropical fish Astyanax aff. paranae was sampled from three sites with different pollution levels: 1) a Biological Reserve (Rebio), protected by the Brazilian government; 2) an agricultural area in one of the most productive regions of Brazil, upstream of an urban zone; and 3) a site downstream from urban zone, characterized by the influx of different effluents, including wastes from industry, a sewer treatment plant, and agricultural areas. We assess biomarkers at multiple levels, such as the comet assay, hepatic histopathological analysis, brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the hepatic enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and lipoperoxidation (LPO), during winter and summer. The interpretation of field results is always a very complex operation, since many factors can influence the variables analyzed in uncontrollable conditions. For this reason, we apply an integrative multivariate analysis. The results showed that the environmental risk of the three sites was significantly different. We can see a gradient in data distribution in discriminant analysis: separating, from one side, the fish of Rebio; in the middle are the fish from agricultural area and, in the other side are the animals from downstream site. Overall, the biomarkers responses were more greatly altered in the downstream site, whereas fish from the agricultural area showed an intermediate level of damage. The greatest changes were likely caused by agriculture, industrial chemical effluents and ineffective sewage treatments, in a synergic interaction in downstream site. In conclusion, the use of multiple biomarkers at different response levels to assess the toxic effects of mixed pollutants in a natural aquatic environment is an important tool for monitoring polluted regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ghisi Nédia C.; Oliveira Elton C.; Guiloski Izonete C.; de Lima Sonia Barbosa; Silva de Assis Helena C.; Longhi Solon Jonas; Prioli Alberto J.,Programa de Pós-graduação em Ecologia de Ambientes Aquáticos e Continentais (PEA)/Nupélia\Universidade Estadual de Maringá (UEM)\Brazil; Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR)\Campus Dois Vizinhos\Brazil; Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR)\Campus Campo Mourão\Brazil; Departamento de Farmacologia\Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR)\Brazil,-,Biochemical biomarkers; Comet assay; Histopathology; Liver; Multivariate analysis; Pesticides
135.html,Total free radical species and oxidation equivalent in polluted air,"Free radicals are the most important chemical intermediate or agent of the atmosphere and influenced by thousands of reactants. The free radicals determine the oxidizing power of the polluted air. Various gases present in smog or haze are oxidants and induce organ and cellular damage via generation of free radical species. At present, however, the high variability of total free radicals in polluted air has prevented the detection of possible trends or distributions in the concentration of those species. The total free radicals are a kind of contaminants with colorless, tasteless characteristics, and almost imperceptible by human body. Here we present total free radical detection and distribution characteristics, and analyze the effects of total free radicals in polluted air on human health. We find that the total free radical values can be described by not only a linear dependence on ozone at higher temperature period, but also a linear delay dependence on particulate matter at lower temperature period throughout the measurement period. The total free radical species distribution is decrease from west to east in Lanzhou, which closely related to the distribution of the air pollutants. The total free radical oxidation capacity in polluted air roughly matches the effects of tobacco smoke produced by the incomplete combustion of a controlled amount of tobacco in a smoke chamber. A relatively unsophisticated chromatographic fingerprint similarity is used for indicating preliminarily the effect of total free radicals in polluted air on human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Guoying; Jia Shiming; Niu Xiuli; Tian Haoqi; Liu Yanrong; Chen Xuefu; Li Lan; Zhang Yuanhang; Shi Gaofeng,School of Petrochemical Engineering\Lanzhou University of Technology\China; Gansu Province Food Inspection Institute\Lanzhou\China; College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering\Peking University\China,-,Free radicals; Human health; Linear correlation; Oxidation equivalent; Polluted air

Here, we have investigated the effect of the substrate temperature. Therefore, hydrogenated carbon thin films were elaborated under the same conditions of laser fluence and CH4pressure but at different substrate temperatures ranging from room temperature to 600 °C. The Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a structural change induced by the substrate temperature increase. Indeed the elaborated thin films evolved from amorphous carbon to hydrogenated graphene as the substrate temperature increases. The elastic recoiled detection analysis and the Rutherford backscattering measurements indicated a decrease in the hydrogen content as well as a thickness reduction along with the substrate temperature increase. We have concluded that the structural change can be ascribed to the increase in the species mobility during the growth.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB)\Laboratoire de Physique des Matériaux\Algeria; Centre de Développement des Technologies Avancées (CDTA)\Cité 20 AoÛt 1956\Algeria; Université des Sciences et de la Technologie Houari Boumediene (USTHB)\Laboratoire de Sciences Nucléaires et Interactions Rayonnements-Matière\Algeria; FEMTO-ST\Time and Frequency Department\France,-,Hydrogenated amorphous carbon; Hydrogenated graphene; Pulsed laser deposition; Raman spectroscopy; X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy
137.html,Higher assimilation than respiration sensitivity to drought for a desert ecosystem in Central Asia,"Responses of ecosystem assimilation and respiration to global climate change vary considerably among terrestrial ecosystems constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors. In this study, net CO2exchange between ecosystem and atmosphere (NEE) was measured over a 4-year period (2013–2016) using eddy covariance technology in a desert ecosystem in Central Asia. Ecosystem assimilation (gross primary production, GPP) and respiration (Reco) were derived from NEE by fitting light response curves to NEE data based on day- and nighttime data, and their responses to soil water content (SWC) and evaporative fraction (EF) were assessed during the growing season. Results indicated that both GPP and Recolinearly decreased with declining SWC, with the sensitivity of GPP to SWC being 3.8 times higher than that of Recoduring the entire growing season. As a result, ecosystem CO2sequestration capacity decreased from 4.00 μmol m− 2s− 1to 1.00 μmol m− 2s− 1, with increasing soil drought.On a seasonal scale, significant correlation between GPP and SWC was only found in spring while that between Recoand SWC was found in all growing seasons with the sensitivity increasing steadily from spring to autumn. EF had a low correlation with SWC, GPP and Reco(R2= 0.03, 0.02, 0.05, respectively), indicating that EF was not a good proxy for soil drought and energy partitioning was not tightly coupled to ecosystem carbon exchanges in this desert ecosystem. The study deepens our knowledge of ecosystem carbon exchange and its response to drought as well as its coupling with ecosystem energy partitioning in an extreme dry desert. The information is critical for better assessing carbon sequestration capacity in dryland, and for understanding its feedback to climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gu Daxing; Otieno Dennis; Huang Yuqing; Wang Quan,Graduate School of Science and Technology\Shizuoka University\Japan; Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science & Technology\4061-210 Bondo\Kenya; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Plant Conservation and Restoration Ecology in Karst Terrain\Guangxi Institute of Botany\China; Faculty of Agriculture\Shizuoka University\Japan,-,Desert ecosystem; Drought sensitivity; Evaporative fraction; Gross primary production
138.html,Human pharmaceuticals in Portuguese rivers: The impact of water scarcity in the environmental risk,"Pharmaceuticals occurrence and environmental risk assessment were assessed in Portuguese surface waters, evaluating the impact of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and river flow rates. Twenty three pharmaceuticals from 6 therapeutic groups, including metabolites and 1 transformation product, were analysed in 72 samples collected from 20 different sites, upstream and downstream the selected WWTPs, in two different seasons. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy. Pharmaceuticals were detected in 27.8% of the samples. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-inflammatories and antibiotics presented the highest detection frequencies (27.8, 23.6 and 23.6%, respectively) and average concentrations (37.9, 36.1 and 33.5 ng L− 1, respectively). When assessing the impact of WWTPs, an increase of 21.4% in the average concentrations was observed in the samples located downstream these facilities, when compared with the upstream samples. Increased detection frequencies and concentrations were observed at lower flow rates, both when comparing summer and winter campaigns and by evaluating the different rivers. Risk quotients (RQs) higher than one were found for two pharmaceuticals, concerning two trophic levels. However, since Iberian rivers are highly influenced by water scarcity, in drought periods, the flow rates in these rivers can decrease at least ten times from the lowest value observed in the sampling campaigns. In these conditions, RQs higher than 1 would be observed for 5 pharmaceuticals, additionally, all the detected pharmaceuticals (11) would present RQs higher than 0.1. These results emphasize that the river flow rate represents an important parameter influencing pharmaceuticals concentrations, highlighting the ecotoxicological pressure, especially due to water scarcity in drought periods. This should be a priority issue in the environmental policies for minimizing its impact in the aquatic environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pereira André M.P.T.; Silva Liliana J.G.; Laranjeiro Célia S.M.; Meisel Leonor M.; Lino Celeste M.; Pena Angelina,LAQV\REQUIMTE\Portugal; Department of Pharmacology\Faculty of Pharmacy\Portugal,-,Environmental contaminants; Environmental risk assessment; Occurrence and fate; Pharmaceuticals; Surface waters; Water scarcity

The need for a more environmentally friendly milk production system will likely be important going forward. Whereas methane (CH4) enteric emissions can only be reduced to a limited extent, CH4manure emissions can be reduced by implementing mitigation strategies, such as the use of an anaerobic digestion (AD). Furthermore, implementing a photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation system could mitigate the fossil fuels used to cover the electrical needs of farms. In the present study to detect the main environmental hotspots of milk production, a Life Cycle Assessment was adopted to build the Life Cycle Inventory according to ISO 14040 and 14044 in a conventional dairy farm (1368 animals) provided by AD and PV systems. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tiered approach was adopted to associate the level of emission with each item in the life cycle inventory. The functional unit refers to 1 kg of fat-and-protein-corrected-milk (FPCM). In addition to milk products, other important co-products need to be considered: meat and renewable energy production from AD and PV systems. A physical allocation was applied to attribute GHG emissions among milk and meat products. Renewable energy production from AD and PV systems was considered, discounting carbon credits due to lower CH4manure emissions and to the minor exploitation of fossil energy. The CF of this farm scenario was 1.11 kg CO2eq/kg FPCM. The inclusion of AD allowed for the reduction of GHG emissions from milk production by 0.26 kg CO2eq/kg FPCM. The PV system contribution was negligible due to the small dimensions of the technology. The results obtained in this study confirm that integrating milk production with other co-products, originated from more efficient manure management, is a successful strategy to mitigate the environmental impact of dairy production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Vida Elisabetta; Tedesco Doriana Eurosia Angela,Department of Environmental Science and Policy\University of Milan\Italy,-,Anaerobic digestion; Carbon credits; Dairy farm; Manure management; Photovoltaic system

Even though, extensive research has been done on the surface energy of pure nanoparticles, the surface energy of alloy nanoparticles has not been considered enough. In this work, based on the liquid drop model for surface energy of pure nanoparticles and Butler's equation, a model for size dependent surface energy of alloy nanoparticles has been developed. In addition to size and concentration, the model can describe the effects of shape and temperature on surface energy of alloy nanoparticles. Cu − Ag and Cu − Au systems have been studied as two examples and the results have been compared with other theoretical models and available simulated data.

The potential of waste biomass for the production of alternative liquid fuels is increasing and the bioconversion of lignocellulose to fermentable monomeric sugars is essential for second-generation biofuel production. Here, natural and pretreated switch grass or rice straw were fermented by both Trichoderma asperellum T-1 and Trichoderma reesei QM6a, with the fermentation results highlighted the potential of T. asperellum T-1 in the degradation of natural waste lignocellulosic materials. In fermenting different substrates, the filter paper activity, β-glucosidase activity, xylanase activity and carboxymethyl cellulase activity of T-1 can respectively reach 1.88, 8.00, 7.15 and 20.52 times that of QM6a. Although acid pretreatment could improve the enzyme activities of both T-1 and QM6a, its effect on T-1 was much smaller than that on QM6a. Moreover, strain T-1 fermented the natural rice straw better than the pretreated rice straw. Therefore, T-1 is considered to be more suitable for the degradation of natural biomass, especially for the degradation of rice straw. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the cellulase series secreted by T. asperellum T-1 was more abundant, and its substrate deconstruction ability was stronger than T. reesei QM6a. All these results suggest the potential of T. asperellum T-1 in the degradation of natural waste lignocellulosic material, with practical benefits in terms of cost and pollution reduction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Qun; Chen Liang; Yu Daobing; Lin Hui; Shen Qi; Zhao Yuhua,Institute of Microbiology\College of Life Sciences\China; Key Laboratory of Recycling and Eco-treatment of Waste Biomass of Zhejiang Province\Research Institute of Eco-environmental Science\China; Zhejiang Gongshang University\Hangzhou\China; School of Forestry and Biotechnology\Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University\China,-,Cellulase; Pretreatment; Rice straw; Switch grass; T. asperellum T-1; T. reesei QM6a

The concentrations of eight heavy metals Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and V were determined by X-Ray Fluorescence. The mean concentrations of these elements were: 30.9 mg kg− 1Co, 145.0 mg kg− 1Cr, 54.7 mg kg− 1Cu, 510.5 mg kg− 1Mn, 30.8 mg kg− 1Ni, 124.5 mg kg− 1Pb, 69.6 mg kg− 1V and 268.6 mg kg− 1Zn. There was significant enrichment of Pb, Zn, Co, Cu and Cr based on geo-accumulation index value. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that levels of Cu, Pb, Zn, Co and Cr were controlled by anthropogenic activities, while levels of Mn, Ni and V were associated with natural sources. Principle component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the source apportionment. The results showed that traffic was the main source with a percent contribution of 53.4%. Natural sources contributed 26.5%, and other anthropogenic pollution sources contributed 20.1%.

GY2B,"Previous study of the effects of surfactants on the biodegradation of phenanthrene focused on investigating alterations of the cell characteristics of Sphingomonas sp. GY2B. However, genes regulation associated with biodegradation and biological processes in response to the presence of surfactants, remains unclear. In this study, comparative transcriptome analysis was conducted to observe the gene expression of GY2B during phenanthrene biodegradation in the presence and absence of Tween80. A diverse set of genes was regulated by Tween80, leading to increased biodegradation of phenanthrene by GY2B: (i) Tween80 increased expression of genes related to H+transport in the plasma membrane to provide a driving force (i.e., ATP) for accelerating transmembrane transport of phenanthrene with increasing Tween80 concentrations, thereby enhancing the uptake and degradation of phenanthrene by GY2B; (ii) Tween80 (1 and 8 CMC) promoted intracellular biodegradation of phenanthrene by stimulating expression of genes encoding dioxygenases and monooxygenase, increasing expression of genes involved in intracellular metabolic processes (e.g., TCA cycle); and (iii) Tween80 likely increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing expression of genes associated with ABC transporters and protein transport, regulating genes involved in other biological processes (e.g., transcription, translation). © 2017",Liu Shasha; Guo Chuling; Lin Weijia; Wu Fengji; Lu Guining; Lu Jing; Dang Zhi,School of Environment and Energy\South China University of Technology\China; Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters\Ministry of Education\China; School of Chemical Engineering and Environment\North University of China\China,-,Biodegradation; Gene expression; Phenanthrene; RNA-Seq; Transcriptome; Tween80

Sequential extraction test results show that Pb2 +was predominantly adsorbed on SB (85.31%), WSP700 (75.61%) and RH700 (85.76%) as acidic soluble fraction, which was potentially bioavailable if applied in soil. The exchangeable fraction for SB, WSP700 and RH700 was low (1.38–4.29%) and their water soluble fraction was negligible (0–0.14%). Micro-structural analysis further investigated this fraction and confirmed the presence of cerussite (PbCO3) on SB and hydrocerussite (Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2) on WSP700, RH 700 and SWP550, suggesting a mechanism of surface precipitation for Pb2 +adsorption on the biochars.

Transposase and IS coding genes were found in the 6 gene clusters, suggesting the mobility of bph and xyl gene clusters. β-ketoadipate and homogentisate pathways were the main central pathways in Sphingomonas and Sphingobium strains. A large number of oxygenase coding genes were predicted in the 26 genomes, indicating a huge biodegradation potential of the Sphingomonas and Sphingobium strains. Horizontal gene transfer related genes and prophages were predicted in the analyzed strains, suggesting the ongoing evolution and shaping of the genomes.

These changes can be explored in areas of research and application, such as construction of nanodevices that act as sensors and filters. Following this idea, in the current work, we present the results from a systematic study of CNT's surface functionalized with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Using the entropy as selection criterion, we filtered a library of 10k stochastically generated complexes for each functional concentration (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25%). The structurally related parameters (root-mean-square deviation, entropy, and volume/area) have a monotonic relationship with functionalization concentration. Differently, the electronic parameters (frontier molecular orbital energies, electronic gap, molecular hardness, and electrophilicity index) present and oscillatory behavior. For a set of concentrations, the nanotubes present spin polarized properties that can be used in spintronics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Laboratório de Modelagem Computacional – LaModel\Instituto de Ciências Exatas\Brazil,-,Carbon nanotubes; Electronic properties; Functionalization; Semi-empirical; Structural properties

The role and content of CA were investigated systematically. It was found that the citric acid-assisted catalysts showed better Pt dispersion and smaller nanoparticle size of Pt. Thus, the catalyst had lower reduction temperature, preferable thermostability and possessed more oxidation state of Pt species under the oxidation atmosphere. The citric acid-induced fresh catalysts were excellent to convert CO and the corresponding aged ones exhibited higher activities for the elimination of all the target pollutants. Among the aged catalysts, P2-a (the mole ratio of Pt/CA is 2:1) presented the best performance. Particularly, compared with the reference sample (Pc-a), the light-off temperatures (T50) of NO, HC and CO for P2-a decreased by 39 °C, 42 °C and 72 °C, respectively, and the full-conversion temperatures (T90) of NO, HC and CO for P2-a decreased by 44 °C, 44 °C and 48 °C, respectively. Therefore, this work provides a facile and valid method to manufacture advanced catalysts for purification of the vehicle exhaust in the future.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cheng Tianqiong; Wang Jianli; Wang Suning; Cui Yajuan; Zhang Hailong; Yan Shuang; Yuan Shandong; Chen Yaoqiang,College of Chemistry\Sichuan University\China; College of Chemical Engineering\Sichuan University\China; State Key Laboratory of Polymer Material Engineering of China (Sichuan University)\Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University\China; Institute of New Energy and Low-carbon Technology\Sichuan University\China,-,Ce-Zr-La-Pr; Citric acid; Pt dispersion; Three-way catalyst

The polymers were prepared over carboxyl-modified silica nanoparticle, which used methacrylic acid as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker agent and azoisobutyronitrile as the initiator in the process of preparation. Various measures were used to characterize the structure and morphology in order to get the optimal polymer. The characterization results show that the optimal polymer has suitable features for further adsorption process. And adsorption capacity experiments were evaluated to analyze its adsorption performance, through adsorption isotherms/kinetics, selectivity adsorption and desorption and regeneration experiments. These results showed that the molecular imprinted polymers had a short equilibrium time about 60 min and high stability with 88% after six cycles. Furthermore, the molecular imprinted polymers were successfully applied to remove dibutyl phthalate. The concentration range was 5.0–30.0 μmol L−1, and the limit of detection was 0.06 μmol L−1in tap water samples.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Wanzhen; Zhang Xiaoming; Huang Weihong; Luan Yu; Yang Yanfei; Zhu Maiyong; Yang Wenming,School of the Environment and Safety Engineering\Jiangsu University\China; School of Materials Science and Engineering\Jiangsu University\China; Zhenjiang Institute for Drug Control of Jiangsu Province\Zhenjiang\China,-,Dibutyl phthalate; Molecular imprinted polymers; Nanoparticles; Selective adsorption
15.html,The Ptolemaic dedication of Archepolis in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina: Materiality and text,"Displayed in the Antiquities Museum of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the Ptolemaic dedication ofArchepolis, son of Kosmos, of the deme Leonnateus, may appear standard in purpose and formulaic in format. Closer study reveals the careful manipulation of traditional elements of the dedicatory formula, reinforced by the layout of the text and palaeography. Of particular interest is the introduction of the royal nomenclature. Archepolis clearly makes his dedication 'on behalf of' the divine, father-loving couple, Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III, rather than simply 'to' them, as seen on many dedicatory plaques within the genre. While not equating to the Pharaonic hetep-di-nesu, the paper will argue a Ptolemaic sensibility in wording. Sarapis and Isis, themselves a divine couple and actual recipients of the dedication, epitomize the Egyptian and Greek religious synthesis and also serve as historical markers for the Battle of Raphia in 217 BCE, where they were heralded as saviours. Ptolemy IV and Arsinoë III were known for their assumption of a variety of divine roles and associations in this hybrid culture, nowhere more famously than on the Arkhelaos Relief depicting the Apotheosis of Homer, unquestionably a product of the Alexandrian literati and the environment of the Great Library itself. The Archepolis dedication, even in its modesty, is in tune with the overall sophistication of the Arkhelaos Relief, while resonating with a Pharaonic subtext in its opening. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

PAPs may transform to persistent perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) under biotic conditions, but little is known about their fate and behavior in aquatic organisms. Here we report for the first time on the uptake, tissue distribution, and biotransformation of 8:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diester (8:2 diPAP) in fish. Gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) were dosed via the diet (8:2 diPAP at 29 μg/g) for 7 days, during which time 8:2 diPAP and its transformation products were monitored in plasma, liver, muscle, gills, bile and brain. 8:2 diPAP tended to accumulate in liver, plasma and gills, and to a lesser extent in muscle, bile and brain. Several transformation products (observed previously in other organisms) were also observed in most tissues and biofluids, including both saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer acids (8:2 FTCA, 8:2 FTUCA, 7:3 FTCA), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). 8:2 FTCA was the major metabolite in all tissues/biofluids, except for bile, where PFOA occurred at the highest concentrations. Unexpectedly high PFOA levels (up to 3.7 ng/g) were also detected in brain. Phase 2 metabolites, which have been reported in fish following exposure to fluorotelomer alcohols, were not observed in these experiments, probably due to their low abundance. Nevertheless, the detection of PFOA indicates that exposure to PAPs may be an indirect route of exposure to PFCAs in fish. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zabaleta Itsaso; Bizkarguenaga Ekhine; Izagirre Urtzi; Negreira Noelia; Covaci Adrian; Benskin Jonathan P.; Prieto Ailette; Zuloaga Olatz,Department of Analytical Chemistry\Faculty of Science and Technology\Spain; Department of Environmental Science and Analytical Chemistry (ACES)\Stockholm University\Sweden; Department of Zoology and Cell Biology\Faculty of Science and Technology\Spain; Research Centre for Experimental Marine Biology and Biotechnology (PIE)\University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)\Spain,-,8:2 diPAP; Biotransformation; Dietary exposure; Gilt-head bream; Tissue distribution

However, increasing human activities at the watershed along with the pressure of climate change are fostering the co-occurrence of multiple environmental drivers, and warn of potential negative impacts on estuaries resources. At present, no clear understanding of how coastal ecosystems will respond to the non-stationary effect of multiple drivers. Here we analysed the temporal interaction among multiple environmental drivers and their changing priority on shaping phytoplankton response in the Bahía Blanca Estuary, SW Atlantic Ocean. The interaction among environmental drivers and the number of significant direct and indirect effects on chlorophyll concentration increased over time in concurrence with enhanced anthropogenic stress, changing winter climate and wind patterns. Over the period 1978–1993, proximal variables such as nutrients, water temperature and salinity, showed a dominant effect on chlorophyll, whereas in more recent years (1993–2009) climate signals (SAM and ENSO) boosted indirect effects through its influence on precipitation, wind, water temperature and turbidity. Turbidity emerged as the dominant driver of chlorophyll while in recent years acted synergistically with the concentration of dissolved nitrogen. As a result, chlorophyll concentration showed a significant negative trend and a loss of seasonal peaks reflecting a pronounced reorganisation of the phytoplankton community. We stress the need to account for the changing priority of drivers to understand, and eventually forecast, biological responses under projected scenarios of global anthropogenic change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",López Abbate M.

152.html,Enhanced photoelectrochemical performance and photocatalytic activity of ZnO/TiO2nanostructures fabricated by an electrostatically modified electrospinning,"In this work, ZnO/TiO2nanostructures were fabricated by an electrostatically modified electrospinning technique using zinc acetate and commercially available TiO2-P25, polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent. The ZnO/TiO2nanostructures were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by electrospinning of aqueous solution containing different amounts of zinc acetate. The TiO2-P25 nanoparticles were immobilized within zinc acetate/PVA nanofibers. The precursor nanofibers obtained were converted into polycrystalline ZnO and ZnO/TiO2by calcination at 600 °C. The structure and morphology of the obtained nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. It was found that the TiO2-P25 nanoparticles were attached to the ZnO nanostructures, and the mean diameter of the nanoparticles forming the nanostructures ranged from 31 to 52 nm with increasing the amount of zinc acetate. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the fabricated nanostructures were measured in a three-electrode cell. The photocatalytic activities of ZnO and ZnO/TiO2nanostructures were evaluated toward the decomposition of methyl orange. The obtained results evidenced that the coupling of TiO2with ZnO enhanced the IPCE and improved the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. Particularly, the ZnO/TiO2nanostructures fabricated with a zinc acetate-to-PVA ratio of 2:3 exhibited the highest IPCE and photocatalytic activity.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ramos Pierre G.; Flores Edson; Sánchez Luis A.; Candal Roberto J.; Hojamberdiev Mirabbos; Estrada Walter; Rodriguez Juan,Facultad de Ciencias\Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería\Peru; Instituto de Investigación e Ingeniería Ambiental\CONICET\Argentina; Department of Natural and Mathematic Sciences\Turin Polytechnic University in Tashkent\Uzbekistan,-,Electrospinning; Nanostructures; Photocatalytic activity; Titanium dioxide; Zinc oxide

The microstructures of the samples were analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). TEM images indicate that the La(OH)3precursors consists of uniform ellipsoids with width of 9–15 nm and length of 15–30 nm and La2O2CO3are spheroidal particles with size of 12–25 nm. XRD patterns indicate that La(OH)3nanocrystallines are hexagonal phase and transform to monoclinic La2O2CO3after annealing. And then, La2O2CO3nanoparticle is printed on an interdigital electrode as a sensing material for CO2detection. La2O2CO3sensor exhibits good cycle stability performance and fast response and recovery (53 s and 120 s) over the wide range of 300–5000 ppm CO2in air condition. In addition, we also investigate the effect of oxygen concentration in the background atmosphere on CO2response of La2O2CO3sensor. The CO2sensing mechanisms for La2O2CO3sensor can be attributed to the interaction of CO2with oxygen species on La2O2CO3surface including chemisorption, surface reaction and desorption process, which also can be used to explain other metal oxide based CO2gas sensor.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ding Degong; Lu Wenbo; Xiong Ya; Pan Xinglong; Zhang Jianqiang; Ling Cuicui; Du Yonggang; Xue Qingzhong,State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing\China University of Petroleum\China; College of Science\China University of Petroleum\China,-,CO2sensing mechanisms; Different oxygen content backgrounds; La2O2CO3nanoparticle film; Oxygen vacancies
154.html,Evaluation of in-sewer transformation of selected illicit drugs and pharmaceutical biomarkers,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is considered to be a useful tool for monitoring chemical consumption in the population. However, the lack of information on potential transformation of biomarkers in the sewer system can compromise the accuracy of the consumption estimation. The present study contributes to addressing this issue by investigating the in-sewer stability of biomarkers from a number of commonly used drugs using laboratory sewer reactors that can mimic different sewer conditions. A stable and an unstable chemical (carbamazepine and caffeine) were also used as benchmarking chemicals to reflect the chemical degradation potential in different sewer conditions. The results suggested that ketamine and norketamine were unstable in gravity and rising main sewers, ketamine was unstable in bulk liquid while norketamine was stable under the same condition. Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the rising main sewer. Morphine and codeine glucuronide were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gao Jianfa; Banks Andrew; Li Jiaying; Jiang Guangming; Lai Foon Yin; Mueller Jochen F.; Thai Phong K.,Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences\The University of Queensland\Australia; Advanced Water Management Center\The University of Queensland\Australia; Toxicological Center\Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences\Belgium; International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health\Queensland University of Technology\Australia,-,Benchmarking chemicals; Biofilm; New psychoactive substances; Stability; Wastewater-based epidemiology
155.html,Preferable adsorption of phosphate using lanthanum-incorporated porous zeolite: Characteristics and mechanism,"The adsorbent, where lanthanum oxide was incorporated onto porous zeolite (La-Z), of preferable adsorption towards phosphate was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Based on pH effect results, La-Z would effectively sequestrate phosphate over wider pH range of 3.0–7.0, alkaline conditions were unfavorable for phosphate. The adsorption of phosphate was not significantly influenced by ionic strength and by coexisting anions of chloride, nitrate and sulfate but bicarbonate showed slightly greater negative effects, indicating La-Z possessed highly selectivity to phosphate. Adsorption of phosphate could be well fitted by pseudo-second-order model and the process was mainly controlled by intra-particle diffusion. Equilibrium adsorption demonstrated that Langmuir model was more suitable than Freundlich model for description phosphate adsorption and the adsorption capacity was 17.2 mg P g−1, which exhibited 95% utilization of incorporated La. Over 95% phosphate was eliminated in real effluent treatment when the dose was 2 g L−1. The underlying mechanism for phosphate capture was probed with Zeta potential and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope analysis, and the formation of La-P inner-sphere complexation was testified to be the dominant pathway. All the results suggested that the porous zeolite-supported lanthanum oxide can serve as a promising adsorbent for phosphate removal in realistic application.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",He Yinhai; Lin Hai; Dong Yingbo; Wang Liang,School of Energy and Environmental Engineering\University of Science and Technology Beijing\China; Beijing Key Laboratory on Resource-oriented Treatment of industrial Pollutants\Beijing\China,-,Adsorption; Inner-sphere complexation; Lanthanum oxide; Phosphate; Porous zeolite
156.html,Geochemical processes controlling groundwater quality under semi arid environment: A case study in central Morocco,"Bahira plain is an important area for Morocco due to its agriculture and mining activities. Situated in a sub-arid to arid climate, this plain hosts an aquifer system that represents sequences of carbonates, phosphates, evaporates and alluvial deposits. Groundwater flows from Ganntour plateau (recharge area) to the basin-fill deposits and Zima Lake and Sed Elmejnoun where water evaporates. The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical properties of the groundwater and to assess the processes controlling the groundwater's chemistry. We can divide water samples into three hydrochemical water groups: recharge waters (Ca/Mg–HCO3), transition zone waters (Ca–HCO3–SO4/Cl) and discharge waters (Na-Cl/SO4). Accordingly, compositions of waters are determined by the availability of easily soluble minerals like calcite (Ca–HCO3dominant), halite (Na–Cl dominant) and gypsum (Ca–SO4dominant). Cl/Br ratios show that Cl concentration increases from dissolution of natural halite. When groundwater is affected by extreme evaporation Cl/Br ratios may increase up to 1900. High fluoride concentrations are associated with low Ca2 +concentrations (< 100 mg/L). That means when recharge waters enter the aquifer, it starts dissolving fluorite since the Ca2 +concentration is low. Once groundwater becomes saturated with Ca2 +, the immobilization of fluoride is occurring by precipitation of fluoride-rich minerals like fluoro-apatite. According to the environmental isotope (18O and2H) analyses, they are three potential processes affecting groundwater: 1. Evaporation as verified by low slope value, 2. Water-rock interaction, 3. admixture of waters showed different stable isotope compositions and salinities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Karroum Morad; Elgettafi Mohammed; Elmandour Abdenabi; Wilske Cornelia; Himi Mahjoub; Casas Albert,Cady Ayyad University\GEOHYD Laboratory\Morocco; Mohamed First University (Pluridisciplinary Faculty of Nador)\OLMAN-RL Laboratory\Morocco; Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ\Dept.

Endocrine disturbances, such as those induced by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can negatively affect spermatogenesis. Here, we investigate whether spermatogenesis is altered in the giant toad, Rhinella marina, living in agricultural areas where EDCs are used relative to suburban areas. We also ask if reductions in spermatogenesis were associated with developmental gonadal abnormalities (intersex) found in the same frogs. We found that toads in agricultural areas exhibited reduced spermatogenesis relative to non-agricultural animals, and that those reductions were not associated with gross gonadal abnormalities. All toads living in agricultural areas had reduced spermatogenesis relative to those living in non-agricultural areas regardless of whether they had gonadal abnormalities originating during development. Similarities in reproductive dysfunction among diverse taxa living in agricultural areas, including humans, suggest that many vertebrate taxa living in agricultural areas around the globe are likely experiencing some level of reproductive dysfunction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",McCoy Krista A.; Amato Ciro M.; Guillette Louis J.; St. Mary Colette M.,Department of Biology\East Carolina University\United States; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (L.J.G.)\Medical University of South Carolina\United States; Department of Biology\University of Florida\United States,-,Agriculture; Giant toad; Pesticides; Reproductive abnormalities; Spermatogenesis
158.html,"Theoretical study of the Pb adsorption on Ni, Cr, Fe surfaces and on Ni based alloys","Adsorption of Pb atoms on the Ni(111), Ni(100), Fe(110), and Cr(110) metallic surfaces was studied theoretically within an ab initio density functional theory approach (DFT). (√3 × √3)R30° super structures for Ni(111), and (2 × 2) for the other surfaces, corresponding to the saturation state, were considered. The preferred adsorption sites are found to be ternary sites for Ni(111), Fe(110), Cr(110) and quaternary sites for Ni(100). Adsorption on Fe and Cr is less exothermic than on Ni, by 0.16 and 0.33 eV/mol respectively. Adsorption on model surfaces of Ni based alloys was also investigated. It was found that the energy of adsorption depends mostly on the chemical composition of the ternary site, and can be described by a linear combination of the energies of adsorption on the pure metals. The nature of the second nearest neighbour of the adsorbed Pb atom has no significant influence on the adsorption energy. Average energies of adsorption were calculated in two cases: the limit of low coverage, and the saturation. The energies of adsorption of Pb at saturation on nickel base alloy surface representative of alloy 600 (Ni-15Cr-8Fe) and alloy 690 (Ni-30Cr-8Fe) were calculated to be 0.07 and 0.11 eV lower than on pure Ni respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bonnet Marie-Laure; Costa Dominique; Protopopoff Elie; Marcus Philippe,PSL Research University\CNRS-Chimie-Paristech\France,-,Adsorption; DFT; Ni base alloy; Pb; Underpotential deposition

It is necessary to clarify the effect of N deposition on greenhouse gas emissions and soil N dynamics for an accurate assessment of C and N budgets under increasing N deposition. In this study, four simulated N deposition treatments (control [CK: no N addition], low-N [L: 20 kg N ha− 1yr− 1], medium-N [M: 40 kg N ha− 1yr− 1], and high-N [H: 80 kg N ha− 1yr− 1]) were operated from 2014. Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide fluxes were monitored semimonthly, as were soil variables such as temperature, moisture and the concentrations of total dissolved N (TDN), NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, and dissolved organic N (DON) in soil solutions. The simulated N deposition resulted in a significant increase in TDN, NO3−and DON concentrations in soil solutions. The average CO2emission rate ranged from 222.6 mg CO2m− 2h− 1in CK to 233.7 mg CO2m− 2h− 1in the high-N treatment. Three years of simulated N deposition had no effect on soil CO2emission, which was mainly controlled by soil temperature. The mean N2O emission rate during the whole 3 years was 0.02 mg N2O m− 2h− 1for CK, which increased significantly to 0.05 mg N2O m− 2h− 1in the high-N treatment. The N2O emission rate positively correlated with NH4+concentrations, and negatively correlated with soil moisture. The average CH4flux during the whole 3 years was − 0.74 μg CH4m− 2h− 1in CK, which increased to 1.41 μg CH4m− 2h− 1in the low-N treatment. CH4flux positively correlated with NO3−concentrations. These results indicate that short-term N deposition did not affect soil CO2emissions, while CH4and N2O emissions were sensitive to N deposition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Song Lei; Tian Peng; Zhang Jinbo; Jin Guangze,Center for Ecological Research\Northeast Forestry University\China; School of Geography Sciences\Nanjing Normal University\China; Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application\Nanjing\China,-,Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen dynamics; Soil variables

It is a cosmographic text in the form of a litany of deities who inhabited the regions of the caverns of the Underworld that were crossed by the sun god in his nightly journey. In the past it was considered part of the Book of Going Forth by Day (chapter 168 in Naville's Book of the Dead edition), but for several decades it has been recognized as an independent text.

The unique three-dimensional (3D) porous network of PEI-GHs is achieved by using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as the cross-linking agent which also facilitate the self-assembly of GO sheets. With unique porous structure, large surface area and sufficient active sites, the PEI-GH has outstanding adsorption capacity (898 mg/g), large removal rate (>90% at ppm level, or ∼85% for ppb level simulated seawater) and high selectivity of uranium. The adsorption process was described well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model.

In this work, N-alkylated polyethylenimine (PEI) is facilely and efficiently introduced onto the membrane surfaces via the co-deposition of catechol (CCh) and PEI, followed by further grafting of PEIs (600 Da, 70 kDa and 750 kDa) and cationization with methyl iodide (CH3I). The physical and chemical properties of the constructed membrane surfaces are characterized with scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential and water contact angle measurements. Antibacterial assay reveals that the optimized membrane surfaces possess around 95% antibacterial efficiency against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) with weak adhesion of bacteria cells after 24 h of bacterial contact. Additionally, the membrane surfaces also exhibit much enhanced antifouling property during the filtration of opposite charged bovine serum albumin (BSA).

163.html,Development of stress corrosion cracking resistant welds of 321 stainless steel by simple surface engineering,"We hereby report a simple surface engineering technique to make AISI grade 321 stainless steel (SS) welds resistant to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in chloride environment. Heat exchanger tubes of AISI 321 SS, welded either by (a) laser beam welding (LBW) or by (b) metal inert gas welding (MIG) were used for the study. The welds had high magnitude of tensile residual stresses and had undergone SCC in chloride environment while in service. The welds were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Subsequently, the welded surfaces were subjected to buffing operation followed by determination of residual stress distribution and surface roughness by XRD and surface profilometer measurements respectively. The susceptibility of the welds to SCC was tested in buffed and un-buffed condition as per ASTM G-36 in boiling MgCl2for 5 h and 10 h, followed by microstructural characterization by using optical microscope and FESEM. The results showed that the buffed surfaces (both welds and base material) were resistant to SCC even after 10 h of exposure to boiling MgCl2whereas the un-buffed surfaces underwent severe SCC for the same exposure time. Buffing imparted high magnitude of compressive stresses on the surface of stainless steel together with reduction in its surface roughness and reduction in plastic strain on the surface which made the welded surface, resistant to chloride assisted SCC.

The physical properties of prepared materials are characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, EDX and FTIR techniques. Furthermore, electrochemical performances of prepared materials are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The resulting Sm2O3modified CuO based electrodes exhibit obviously enhanced capacitive properties owing to the unique nanostructures and strong synergistic effects. It is worth noting that the optimized SC-3 based electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performances in all prepared electrodes, including higher specific capacitance (383.4 F g−1at 0.5 A g−1) and good rate capability (393.2 F g−1and 246.3 F g−1at 0.3 A g−1and 3.0 A g−1, respectively), as well as excellent cycling stability (84.6% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). The present results show that Sm2O3is used as a promising modifier to change the morphology and improve electrochemical performances of CuO materials.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Xiaojuan; He Mingqian; He Ping; Liu Hongtao; Bai Hongmei; Chen Jingchao; He Shaoying; Zhang Xingquan; Dong Faqing; Chen Yang,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Southwest University of Science and Technology\China; Sichuan Changhong New Energy Technology Co.

Molten pool behavior, morphology feature of sulfide inclusions, metallographic structures, XRD patterns, microhardness, potentiodynamic polarization curves and pitted surface have been investigated and discussed. The results indicated that the added sulfur powder improved the weld depth by increasing molten metal fluidity, elongating molten pool and promoting heat transmission. The observed sulfide inclusions had small particle size of 0.65 μm in average and were distributed sparsely in weld joint. The WWS (weld joint with sulfur powder) had higher δ-ferrite content and finer grain size than the WWOS (weld joint without sulfur powder) and BM (base metal) due to the effects of sulfide inclusions on crystallizing process. The preferred orientations of γ-austenite along the (200) and (220) directions were promoted both in WWS and WWOS. Fine grain size and high δ-ferrite content led to high microhardness. The WWS had the highest microhardness among all the specimens. The WWOS and BM had a similar corrosion resistance. By comprehensive comparison, the WWS had a relative lower corrosion resistance than others, since sulfide inclusions in WWS not only had some benefits but also had some bad effects on corrosion property. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Shichun; Deng Zhaohui; Deng Hui; Xu Wei,Intelligent Manufacturing Institute of HNUST\Hunan University of Science and Technology\China; Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of High Efficiency and Precision Machining of Difficult-to-Cut Material\Hunan University of Science and Technology\China,-,Corrosion property; Laser welding; Microstructure; Sulfide inclusion; Surface-active element

The understanding of its dynamics and the environmental factors that influence its behaviour as sink or source of atmospheric CO2is crucial to quantify the carbon budget at the global scale. At the European scale, most of the existing studies to account for SOC stocks are centred in the fitting of predictive model to ascertain the distribution of SOC. However, the development of methodologies for monitoring and identifying the environmental factors that control SOC storage in Europe remains a key research challenge. Here we present a modelling procedure for mapping and monitoring SOC contents that uses Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) spectroscopic measurements and a series of environmental covariates to ascertain the key environmental processes that have a major contribution into SOC sequestration processes. Our results show that it follows a geographically non-stationary process in which the influencing environmental factors have different weights depending on the spatial location. This implies that SOC stock modelling should not rely on a single model but on a combination of different statistical models depending on the environmental characteristics of each area. A cluster classification of European soils in relation to those factors resulted in the determination of four groups for which specific models have been obtained. Differences in climate, soil pH, content of coarse fragments or land cover type are the main factors explaining the differences in SOC in topsoil from Europe. We found that climatic conditions are the main driver of SOC storage at the continental scale, but we also found that parameters like land cover type influence SOC content found at the local scales in certain areas. Our methodology developed at continental scale could be used in future research aimed to improve the predictive performance of SOC assessments at European scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Departamento de Edafoloxía e Química Agrícola\Facultade de Bioloxía\Spain,-,Infrared spectroscopy; Machine learning; Soil organic carbon; Spatial statistics

The sheet-like reduced graphene oxide (rGO) wrapped around the skeleton of Ni foam establishes a unique structure of the current collector with large surface area as well as good electronic conductivity which make a positive effect on the promotion of electrochemical property. Pd is chosen as the catalyst and deposited on the RN substrate in a form of nanoparticle by potentiostatic electro-deposition. Characterization analysis including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP) are conducted to investigate the morphology and structure of the final electrode of Pd nanoparticles decorated rGO supported on Ni foam (PRN). In 2 mol L−1NaOH and 0.5 mol L−1H2O2, a current density of 450 mA cm−2is gained on the PRN electrode which is much larger than that on the electrode of Pd nanoparticles directly deposited on Ni foam (PN). An excellent stability of the PRN electrode is also concluded by the measurements revealing that this material can be potentially and widely applied to direct hydrogen peroxide fuel cell in the near future.                          © 2017",Song Congying; Cao Liu; Li Biaopeng; Huang Xiaomei; Ye Ke; Zhu Kai; Cao Dianxue; Cheng Kui; Wang Guiling,Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education\College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering\China,-,Electrocatalysis; Graphene modified Ni foam; Hydrogen peroxide electroreduction; Hydrothermal method; Pd nanoparticles

Various electrochemical parameters (corrosion potential Ecorr, corrosion current (icorr), polarisation resistance Rp, charge transfer resistance Rctand oxide film resistance Rf) were analysed. Significant coherence was observed between results achieved from these procedures, i.e., all applied techniques showed the same trend for corrosion resistance. The obtained electrochemical data were then related to the microstructure parameters (crystallographic texture, grain size, grain boundary distribution and density) determined using the EBSD/SEM technique. It was found that the corrosion behaviour of titanium processed by the HE method was superior compared to the unprocessed Ti, and this was clearly dependent on the extrusion direction. The highest corrosion resistance was revealed for the HE-deformed Ti rod of the surface oriented longitudinal (parallel) to the extrusion direction.                          © 2017",-,Institute of Metallurgy and Materials Science\Polish Academy of Sciences 25 Reymonta St.\Poland; Faculty of Chemistry\Jagiellonian University\Poland; Faculty of Metals Engineering and Industrial Computer Science\AGH University of Science and Technology\Poland; Institute of High Pressure Physics\Polish Academy of Sciences\Poland,-,Corrosion; Crystallographic texture; Dental implants; Hydrostatic extrusion; Titanium
17.html,Rethinking Egyptian animal worship (c. 3000 BC - c. 300 AD): Towards a historical-religious perspective,"While the variety of animal imagery in iconography/literature is acknowledged as a visual metaphor, animal worship - the actual involvement of living creatures in ritual practice - still confronts us with a curious contradiction: Commonly perceived as one of the most qualifying features of Egyptian religion, since Herodotus it has strongly impressed our Western kulturelle Gedächtnis; on the other hand, it is (dis)regarded as a marginal phenomenon both on historical and interpretative grounds. Such a contradiction arises from two structural deficits: Lack of a theoretical framework, resulting in an anachronistic repetition of paradigms of classical/biblical derivation; lack of a historical perspective, producing simplifications in the evaluation of the phenomenon and its articulation. The present paper summarises part of the results of my PhD dissertation and points out major foci and preliminary results of a research project developed from it. By adopting a historical-religious perspective, animal worship will be addressed as a historical product of religious practice, and an attempt will be made to investigate the forms it assumed over time as well as to outline a possible diachronic framework. The final goals are: (1) to reassess the heuristic utility of 'animal worship' as analytical category; (2) to reconsider its practical dimension as a focal point in interpretation; (3) to suggest that the integration of selected individuals or groups of animals into specific ritual contexts occurred all along the pharaonic period, while the monumentalisation of such practices allows setting them in a historical framework. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The glass surface shows the hierarchical structures containing both micro- and nanoscale roughness after laser irradiation. The increase in glass surface roughness makes the surface exhibit superhydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 0°. After surface modification with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane, the glass surface exhibits stable superhydrophobicity. By varying the laser line intervals, we can regulate the surface morphology and the wetting properties. With the increase of laser line interval, the contact angles of the glass surfaces range from 172° ± 1° to 156° ± 2° and the sliding angles can be ignored. Before chemical surface modification, we also find that the glass surface of hierarchical structures is superoleophobic underwater. The contact angle for chloroform is 163° ± 2° and the sliding angle is 1.5° ± 0.4°. In addition, the as-prepared glass surface shows excellent transparency and its average transmittance is up to 87.28% in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the water droplet on the modified original glass surface looks like a lens which has zoom function. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Bing; Hua Yinqun; Ye Yunxia; Chen Ruifang; Li Zhibao,School of Material and Science Engineering\Jiangsu University\China; School of Mechanical Engineering\Jiangsu University\China,-,Contact angle; Groove-shaped arrays; Picosecond laser; Superhydrophobic solar glass; Superoleophobic; Wettability transformation

The surface–enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensity of 4MBA adhered on the surface of Au core gradually increased with the modification of middle Ag shell and then Ag mushroom cap due to the formation of two kinds of ultra–small interior nanogap. Compared with the initial Au nanoparticles, the SERS enhancement ratio of the Au@Ag@PSPAA@Ag NMs approached to nearly 40. The novel core–shell NMs also exhibited homogeneous SERS signals for only one sample and reproducible signals for 10 different samples, certified by the low relative standard deviation values of less than 10% and 15% for the character peaks of 4–mercaptobenzoic acid, respectively. Such a novel four–layer core–shell nanostructure with reliable SERS performance has great potential application in quantitative SERS–based immunoassay. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Jiang Tao; Wang Xiaolong; Zhou Jun,Department of Microelectronic Science and Engineering\Institute of Photonics\China,-,Core–shell nanostructure; Inbuilt Raman molecule; Nanomushroom; Surface–enhanced Raman scattering

Here we report the synthesis and characterization of octahedral CoFe2O4nanoparticles obtained through a novel aqueous method that employs betaine, (CH3)3+NCH2COO−, as the stabilizer agent. The synthetic conditions are modified changing the betaine content and the metal precursor ratios. These conditions modify the shape of CoFe2O4finding both, octahedral and semi-spherical nanoparticles. Linear voltammetry measurements show the octahedral CoFe2O4lead to an overpotential of ∼390 mV at the onset potential for water oxidation at alkaline conditions. Among the as-synthesized cobalt-ferrite nanomaterials, the CoFe(1:2)-C in the form of tiny nanoparticles performed a superior electrocatalytic water oxidation in alkaline conditions, showing an overpotential of ∼335 mV, which is lower than other similar catalysts in literature.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Electroquímica–Tijuana\Carr.

173.html,Anisotropic surface physicochemical properties of spodumene and albite crystals: Implications for flotation separation,"Aluminosilicate minerals (e.g., spodumene, albite) have complex crystal structures and similar surface chemistries, but they have poor selectivity compared to traditional fatty acid collectors, making flotation separation difficult. Previous research has mainly considered the mineral crystal structure as a whole. In contrast, the surface characteristics at the atomic level and the effects of different crystal interfaces on the flotation behavior have rarely been investigated. This study focuses on investigating the surface anisotropy quantitatively, including the chemical bond characteristics, surface energies, and broken bond densities, using density functional theory and classical theoretical calculations. In addition, the anisotropy of the surface wettability and adsorption characteristics were examined using contact angle, zeta potential, and Fourier-transform infrared measurements. Finally, these surface anisotropies with different flotation behaviors were investigated and interpreted using molecular dynamics simulations, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This systematic research offers new ideas concerning the selective grinding and stage flotation of aluminosilicate minerals based on the crystal characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Longhua; Peng Tiefeng; Tian Jia; Lu Zhongyuan; Hu Yuehua; Sun Wei,Key Laboratory of Solid Waste Treatment and Resource Recycle Ministry of Education\Southwest University of Science and Technology\China; School of Resources Processing and Bioengineering\Central South University\China; State Key Laboratory of Mineral Processing\Beijing\China,-,Anisotropic adsorption; Crystal plane; Flotation; Spodumene
174.html,"Impact of climate variability and change on crime rates in Tangshan, China","Studies examining the relation between climate and human conflict often focus on the role of temperature and have diverging views on the significance of other climatic variables. Using a 6-year (from 2009 to 2014) dataset of crime statistics collected in a medium size city of Tangshan in China, we find strong, positive correlations between temperature and both violent and property crimes. In addition, relative humidity is also positively correlated with Rape and Minimal Violent Robbery (MVR). The seasonal cycle is a significant factor that induces good correlations between crime rates and climatic variables, which can be reasonably explained by the Routine Activity theory. We also show that the combined impacts of temperature and relative humidity on crime rates can be reasonably captured by traditional heat stress indices. Using an ensemble of CMIP5 global climate change simulations, we estimate that at the end of the 21st century the rates of Rape (violent crime) and MVR (property crime) in Tangshan will increase by 9.5 ± 5.3% and 2.6 ± 2.1%, respectively, under the highest emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). The gross domestic product (GDP) is also shown to be significantly correlated with MVR rates and the regression results are strongly impacted by whether GDP is considered or not. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hu Xiaofeng; Wu Jiansong; Chen Peng; Sun Ting; Li Dan,School of Information Technology and Network Security\People's Public Security University of China\China; Department of Safety Engineering\China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)\China; Department of Hydraulic Engineering\Tsinghua University\China; Department of Earth and Environment\Boston University\United States,-,Climate; Crime rate; GDP; Heat stress; Relative humidity; Seasonality; Temperature
175.html,Taxonomic and functional patterns across soil microbial communities of global biomes,"Soil microbial communities have been shown to vary across many spatial scales, yet while variability exists between samples closely located in the same soil, variation between soils of different ecosystems is larger, creating biogeographic trends. Herein, thirty publically-available metagenomes from 11 globally distributed ecosystems were selected. These metagenomes were clustered by biome (i.e. forest, grasslands, tundra, semiarid and desert) based on morphoclimatic features. Protein biosynthesis, central carbohydrate metabolism, and antibiotic resistance were the most statistically different SEED subsystems among biome groups. CAZy-based annotation revealed that genes related to biomass degradation, sucrose and starch metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis were overrepresented in forest and grasslands soils. As expected, desiccation and other stress resistance genes were prevalent in desert and semiarid soils. Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) were more abundant in forest and grassland soils, and multidrug efflux pumps were the most abundant ARG class. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) were generally more abundant in tundra, semiarid and desert. However, HSP60 and HSP20, predominantly from Archaea, were enriched in the Saline Desert soils. These results suggest that while a core microbiome and functional potential exist in all studied soils, local environmental conditions select for enrichment of specific functions important for survival in a given ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Noronha Melline Fontes; Lacerda Júnior Gileno Vieira; Gilbert Jack A.; de Oliveira Valéria Maia,Microbial Resources Division\Multidisciplinary Center for Chemistry\Brazil; Institute of Biology\Campinas University\Brazil; The Microbiome Center\Department of Surgery\United States; The Microbiome Center\Bioscience Division\United States,-,Antibiotics resistance genes; Biomes; Carbohydrateactive enzymes (CAZymes); Microbial community; Soil metagenomics

The Taguchi L16experimental design was applied to evaluate the effects of reaction time, type and concentration of the additive, type of the chelating agent, and the molar ratio of the chelating agent to the initial zinc (II) ions. The prepared sample at the optimal conditions exhibited a sustainable and time-independent superhydrophobic behavior with the water contact angle (WCA) of 162.8° ± 2.5° and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of 1.8° ± 0.5°. The XRD, SEM, TEM and FTIR analyses were used to characterize the prepared samples. Surface characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated accumulation of micro/nano branched ZnO needles on the substrate with the average diameters of ∼85 nm. After 20 abrasion cycles the optimum sample indicated an excellent mechanical robustness via exposure to the pressure of 4.7 kPa.

A review of background knowledge,"This article analyses whether existing LCA and sustainability methods can be used in the assessment of a city or an urban region. The approach is performed through the review of current existing LCA-based and sustainability standards and guidelines. A focus is put into those LCA-based standards specially designed for the built environment. Moreover, a review of non-LCA based standards, indices and guides for the assessment of the sustainability of countries, cities or urban regions is done. The purpose is to check if these assessment tools can provide good results in the absence of LCA-based assessments for cities and urban regions. This review demonstrates the lack of consensus in the definition of both, the city and its boundaries, which hinders the development of useful sustainability standards. Furthermore, it is concluded that current sustainability assessment tools miss, at least, one of these aspects: (i) holistic point of view, (ii) focus on various environmental impacts, (iii) a Life Cycle (LC) perspective, and (iv) the possibility to compare the results among different cities or urban regions. From the LCA perspective, the deficiencies found also include the need for a definition of the function, functional unit (FU), and reference flow (RF) of neighbourhoods, cities, and urban regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Albertí Jaume; Balaguera Alejandra; Brodhag Christian; Fullana-i-Palmer Pere,UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change\ESCI-UPF\Spain; Facultad de Ingenierías\Universidad de Medellín\Colombia; École des Mines de Saint-Étienne (EMSE)\158\France,-,City definition; Life cycle perspective; Sustainability approaches; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability indices; Urban regions
178.html,Risks associated with the environmental release of pharmaceuticals on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration “flush list”,"A select few prescription drugs can be especially harmful and, in some cases, fatal with just one dose when not used as prescribed. Therefore, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that expired, unwanted, or otherwise unused portions of most of these drugs be disposed of quickly through a take-back program. If such an option is not readily available, FDA recommends that they be flushed down the sink or toilet. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate the ecological and human-health risks associated with the environmental release of the 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) currently on the FDA “flush list”. The evaluation suggests that even when highly conservative assumptions are used—including that the entire API mass supplied for clinical use is flushed, all relevant sources in addition to clinical use of the API are considered, and no metabolic loss, environmental degradation, or dilution of wastewater effluents are used in estimating environmental concentrations—most of these APIs present a negligible eco-toxicological risk, both as individual compounds and as a mixture. For a few of these APIs, additional eco-toxicological data will need to be developed. Using similar conservative assumptions for human-health risks, all 15 APIs present negligible risk through ingestion of water and fish. © 2017",Khan Usman; Bloom Raanan A.; Nicell James A.; Laurenson James P.,Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education\Oak Ridge\United States; Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\U.S. Food and Drug Administration\United States; Department of Civil Engineering & Applied Mechanics\McGill University\Canada,-,Disposal; Environmental impact; Flush list; Opioids; Pharmaceuticals; Wastewater

Active turbulence grids and boundary layer generation frame were used to simulate the natural winds in wind tunnel experiments. As a result, the mean wind velocity, the velocity vector diagram and turbulence intensity around the hills were investigated by using a PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) system. From the measurement results, it was known that the average velocity was increased along the upstream slope of upside hill, and then separated at the top of the hills, the acceleration region of U/Uref> 1 was generated at the downstream of the hill. Meanwhile, a large clockwise circulation flow was generated between the two hill models. Moreover, the turbulence intensity showed small value in the circulation flow regions. Compared to 1H model, the turbulence intensity in the mainstream direction showed larger value than that in the vertical direction.

18.html,Overlapping and contradictory narratives in Ancient Egyptian visual programs,"The complexity and inherent multiplicity of representation in ancient Egyptian visual and literary narrative construction is counter-intuitive to western and modern understandings of narrative, which is typically linear and structurally uncomplicated. In ancient Egyptian mythological texts, literary motifs can be arranged and rearranged to create multiple, and at times, contradictory stories which were all accepted and incorporated in the overall mythology. This open-ended way of constructing textual narrative is also seen in ancient Egyptian visual narratives, in which various motifs within a tomb or a temple have the potential to be arranged and rearranged to construct new orders and interpretations. For instance, in ancient Egyptian tombs, common vignettes, such as 'fishing and fowling' and cattle butchering can be arranged according to the taste of the individual tomb owner, while still maintaining a larger overarching narrative that traces the tomb owner's journey from the afterlife to rebirth. This paper elaborates on the ancient Egyptian understanding that the world can be explained in multiple, even if at times, contradictory ways, while also showing how this complex worldview is manifested in ancient Egyptian narrative construction. This nuanced understanding of visual narrative construction will be applied to the imagery of anthropomorphized animals on New Kingdom papyri and ostraca, which have often been described as referencing folktales not preserved in the archaeological record. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

181.html,"Effects of single metal atom (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru) adsorption on the photocatalytic properties of anatase TiO2","The effects of single metal atom (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru) adsorption on the photocatalytic properties of anatase TiO2are investigated by means of the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the most stable adsorption site for single metal atom on anatase TiO2(101) surface is the bridge site formed by two twofold coordinated oxygen (O2c) atoms at the step edge. Due to the charge transfer from metal atoms to anatase TiO2(101) surface, the work function of adsorbed surface is significantly smaller than the clean one, indicating enhanced surface activity. Fukui functions are highly localized around the isolated metal atoms, indicating that single metal atoms on anatase TiO2(101) surface serve as the active reduction and oxidation sites in the photocatalytic process. Photo-induced electrons in the electronically excited TiO2photocatalyst can be transferred to target species through the deposited single atoms. The band structures of host TiO2are almost unchanged upon the adsorption, and the metal induced states are located in the band gap of the host. Remarkably, due to the metal atoms adsorption, the upward shift of conduction band edge will improve the reducing capacity of anatase TiO2. Moreover, when single metal atoms are adsorbed, potential energy of topmost surface Ti atoms turns to get close to the vacuum level, which significantly facilitates the electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Results in this work provide new insights into improving the photocatalytic performance by single metal atoms adsorption.                          © 2017",Jin Cui; Dai Ying; Wei Wei; Ma Xiangchao; Li Mengmeng; Huang Baibiao,School of Physics\State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials\China,-,Active sites; Anatase TiO2; Photocatalytic; Reducing capacity; Single-atom catalysts
182.html,A dual amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of microRNA,"Here, we present a dual amplification strategy based on a duplex-specific nuclease and a hybridization chain reaction, which has been designed for the highly sensitive detection of miRNAs. In the first step, a loop amplification strategy based on a duplex-specific nuclease was employed to obtain a large number of ssDNA reporters that then act as initiators to trigger the next amplification step. The second step involves a hybridization chain reaction based on two hairpin DNAs denoted as H1and H2. Doxorubicin-CdTe quantum dots, which function as detecting indicators that intercalated into the hybridization chain reaction products, lead to significantly amplified electrochemiluminescence signal readout. This dual amplification strategy enabled the sensitive detection of let-7d from 10 aM to 10 nM with a detection limit of 10 aM, and offered an excellent capacity to discriminate between microRNA family members. This assay therefore offers great potential applications in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lu Liping; Yang Bingjie; Kang Tianfang,Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control\College of Environmental and Energy Engineering\China,-,Duplex-specific nuclease; Electrochemiluminescence; Hybridization chain reaction; MicroRNA; Signal amplification

SD density was reduced down to 1.9 × 1013cm−2by skipping HCl pre-treatment step as compared to 3.3 × 1013cm−2for structures with HCl pre-treatment followed by PDA. The nature and origin of SD was then analyzed based on the correlation between electrical, micro-structural, and chemical properties of the Al2O3/GaN interfaces with different SD density (NSD). From the comparison between distributions of interface traps of MOS heterojunction with different NSD, it is demonstrated that SD cannot be attributed to interface trapped charge. Instead, variation in the integrity of the GaOxinterlayer confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is well correlated with NSD, indicating SD may be formed by border traps at the Al2O3/GaOxinterface.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Institute of Electrical Engineering\Slovak Academy of Sciences\Slovakia; Institute of Technical Physics and Materials Sciences\MTA EK\Hungary; Ferdinand-Braun-Institut\Leibniz Institut für Höchstfrequenztechnik\Germany,-,AlGaN/GaN; Interface states; MOS-HEMT; Surface donors
185.html,Comparison of POCIS passive samplers vs. composite water sampling: A case study,"The relevance of Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) was evaluated for the assessment of concentrations of 46 pesticides and 19 pharmaceuticals in a small, peri-urban river with multi-origin inputs. Throughout the period of POCIS deployment, 24 h-average water samples were collected automatically, and showed the rapid temporal evolution of concentrations of several micropollutants, as well as permitting the calculation of average concentrations in the water phase for comparison with those estimated from POCIS passive samplers. In the daily water samples, cyproconazol, epoxyconazol and imidacloprid showed high temporal variations with concentrations ranging from under the limit of detection up to several hundreds of ng L− 1. Erythromycin, cyprofloxacin and iopromide also increased rapidly up to tens of ng L− 1within a few days. Conversely, atrazine, caffeine, diclofenac, and to a lesser extent carbamazepine and sucralose, were systematically present in the water samples and showed limited variation in concentrations. For most of the substances studied here, the passive samplers gave reliable average concentrations between the minimal and maximal daily concentrations during the time of deployment. For pesticides, a relatively good correlation was clearly established (R2= 0.89) between the concentrations obtained by POCIS and those gained from average water samples. A slight underestimation of the concentration by POCIS can be attributed to inappropriate sampling rates extracted from the literature and for our system, and new values are proposed. Considering the all data set, 75% of the results indicate a relatively good agreement between the POCIS and the average water samples concentration (values of the ratio ranging between 0,33 and 3). Note further that this agreement between these concentrations remains valid considering different sampling rates extracted from the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Criquet Justine; Dumoulin David; Howsam Michael; Mondamert Leslie; Goossens Jean-François; Prygiel Jean; Billon Gabriel,Univ.

186.html,Fabrication of PAN@TiO2/Ag nanofibrous membrane with high visible light response and satisfactory recyclability for dye photocatalytic degradation,"Although TiO2-based photocatalysts have exhibited a great potential for degradation of organic pollutants, it is still necessary to simultaneously enhance their visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency and physical recyclability. Herein, highly efficient, visible-light-driven photocatalytically active, and recyclable nanofibrous membranes with thin TiO2/Ag heterojunction layer are prepared using electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membrane as the substrate. By regulating the concentration and hydrolysis process of Ti precursors, TiO2nanoparticles steadily grow on the PAN nanofibers with high-specific surface area to form a continuous mesoporous shell with the thickness of 20 nm for efficient degradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, to form a stable heterojunction structure, Ag nanoparticles are deposited on the TiO2surface by using dopamine as a binder and reductant. The presence of Ag nanoparticles leads to an obvious red-shift from 380 nm to 490 nm, which improves the utilization efficiency of visible light, and reduces the electron/hole recombination rate simultaneously. The resulting PAN@TiO2/Ag membranes hold enhanced photocatalytic activity for methylene blue degradation within 1 h under visible light irradiation, and satisfactory recyclability, which endow them with a great potential for adsorption and photocatalytic applications.                          © 2017",Shi Yongzheng; Yang Dongzhi; Li Yuan; Qu Jin; Yu Zhong-Zhen,State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites\College of Materials Science and Engineering\China; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering\Beijing University of Chemical Technology\China,-,Ag nanoparticles; Electrospun membranes; Methylene blue; Photocatalytic activity; Titanium dioxide
187.html,Effect of dielectric barrier discharge treatment on surface nanostructure and wettability of polylactic acid (PLA) nonwoven fabrics,"Polylactic acid (PLA) nonwoven fabrics are treated with atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma to improve surface wettability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that micro- to nano-scale textures appear on the treated PLA surfaces dependent on the treatment time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that the DBD plasma treatments result in decreased carbon contents and increased oxygen contents as well as slightly increased nitrogen contents. The water contact angle decreases sharply with the increase of the DBD plasma treatment time. The super hydrophilic PLA surfaces (the water contact angle reached 0°) are obtained when the treatment time is longer than 90 s. Ninety days after the DBD plasma treatment, the XPS analysis shows that C–O/C–N and C[dbnd]O/O–C[dbnd]O percentages decline for all treatment groups. However, the water contact angle is kept constant at 0° for the groups treated above 90 s, which could be due to the oxidized nano-structured layer on the DBD plasma treated PLA surfaces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ren Yu; Xu Lin; Wang Chunxia; Wang Xiaona; Ding Zhirong; Chen Yuyue,School of Textile and Clothing\Nantong University\China; College of Textile and Clothing Engineering\Soochow University\China; Kuangda Fibre Technology Co.\Ltd.\China; College of Textiles and Clothing\Yancheng Institute of Technology\China,-,Aging effect; Dielectric barrier discharge; Polylactic acid; Surface topography; Wettability
188.html,Sea level anomaly in the North Atlantic and seas around Europe: Long-term variability and response to North Atlantic teleconnection patterns,"Sea level anomaly (SLA), provided globally by satellite altimetry, is considered a valuable proxy for detecting long-term changes of the global ocean, as well as short-term and annual variations. In this manuscript, monthly sea level anomaly grids for the period 1993–2013 are used to characterise the North Atlantic Ocean variability at inter-annual timescales and its response to the North Atlantic main patterns of atmospheric circulation variability (North Atlantic Oscillation, Eastern Atlantic, Eastern Atlantic/Western Russia, Scandinavian and Polar/Eurasia) and main driven factors as sea level pressure, sea surface temperature and wind fields. SLA variability and long-term trends are analysed for the North Atlantic Ocean and several sub-regions (North, Baltic and Mediterranean and Black seas, Bay of Biscay extended to the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, and the northern North Atlantic Ocean), depicting the SLA fluctuations at basin and sub-basin scales, aiming at representing the regions of maximum sea level variability. A significant correlation between SLA and the different phases of the teleconnection patterns due to the generated winds, sea level pressure and sea surface temperature anomalies, with a strong variability on temporal and spatial scales, has been identified. Long-term analysis reveals the existence of non-stationary inter-annual SLA fluctuations in terms of the temporal scale. Spectral density analysis has shown the existence of long-period signals in the SLA inter-annual component, with periods of ~ 10, 5, 4 and 2 years, depending on the analysed sub-region. Also, a non-uniform increase in sea level since 1993 is identified for all sub-regions, with trend values between 2.05 mm/year, for the Bay of Biscay region, and 3.98 mm/year for the Baltic Sea (no GIA correction considered). The obtained results demonstrated a strong link between the atmospheric patterns and SLA, as well as strong long-period fluctuations of this variable in spatial and temporal scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Iglesias Isabel; Lorenzo M.

We evaluated in this study the importance of these forcing events on modulating seasonal changes in the marine biogeochemistry of the northwestern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, based on data gathered from a fixed coastal sampling station in the area. A 4-year (2011–2014) monthly sampling at four depths (0.5 m, 20 m, 50 m and 80 m) was performed to examine the time variability of several oceanographic variables: seawater temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO3−, PO43 −and SiO2), chlorophyll a (Chl a), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). FDOM dynamics was predominantly influenced by upwelling events and mixing processes, driven by strong and characteristic wind episodes. SW wind episodes favored the upwelling of deeper and denser waters into the shallower shelf, providing a surplus of autochthonous humic-like material and inorganic nutrients, whereas northerlies favored the homogenization of the whole shelf water column by cooling and evaporation. These different wind-induced processes (deep water intrusion or mixing), reported along the four sampled years, determined a high interannual environmental variability in comparison with other Mediterranean sampling sites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Aparicio Fran L.; Nieto-Cid Mar; Calvo Eva; Pelejero Carles; López-Sanz Àngel; Pascual Josep; Salat Jordi; Sánchez-Pérez Elvia D.; La Fuente Patricia De; Gasol Josep M.; Marrasé Cèlia,ICM-CSIC\Institut de Ciències del Mar\Spain; IIM-CSIC\Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas\Spain; ICREA\Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats\Spain; Estació Meteorològica de L'Estartit\Girona\Spain,-,DOC; FDOM; Inorganic nutrients; NW Mediterranean; Salinity; Wind events

190.html,Veterinary pharmaceutical contamination in mixed land use watersheds: from agricultural headwater to water monitoring watershed,"Veterinary pharmaceuticals, widely used in intensive livestock production, may contaminate surface waters. Identifying their sources and pathways in watersheds is difficult because i) most veterinary pharmaceuticals are used in human medicine as well and ii) septic or sewer wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) can release pharmaceuticals into surface water, even in agricultural headwater watersheds. This study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of animal-specific, mixed-use, and human-specific pharmaceuticals, from agricultural headwaters with intensive livestock production and a WWTP to a watershed used for Water Framework Directive monitoring. Grab sampling was performed during one hydrological year upstream and downstream from a WWTP and at three dates in seven nested watersheds with areas of 1.9–84.1 km2. Twenty pharmaceuticals were analyzed. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected at all sampling dates upstream and downstream from the WWTP and at concentrations higher than those of human-specific pharmaceuticals. The predominance of animal-specific and mixed-use pharmaceuticals vs. human-specific pharmaceuticals observed at these sampling points was confirmed at the other sampling points. Animal-specific pharmaceuticals were detected mainly during runoff events and periods of manure spreading. A large percentage of mixed-use pharmaceuticals could come from animal sources, but it was difficult to determine. Mixed-use and human-specific pharmaceuticals predominated in the largest watersheds when runoff decreased. In areas of intensive livestock production, mitigation actions should focus on agricultural headwater watersheds to decrease the number of pathways and the transfer volume of veterinary pharmaceuticals, which can be the main contaminants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,UMR SAS\AGROCAMPUS OUEST\France; Geosciences Rennes CNRS UMR 6118\Rennes\France; LABOCEA\Ploufragan\France; Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Santé Publique\Rennes\France,-,Agricultural; Antimicrobials; Livestock; Pharmaceutical; Wastewater treatment; Watershed
191.html,DFT studies of elemental mercury oxidation mechanism by gaseous advanced oxidation method: Co-interaction with H2O2on Fe3O4(111) surface,"Density functional theory calculations have been carried out for H2O2and Hg0co-interaction on Fe3O4(111) surface. On the Fetet1-terminated Fe3O4(111) surface, the most favored configurations are H2O2decomposition and produce two OH groups, which have strong interaction with Hg atom to form an OH–Hg–OH intermediate. The adsorbed OH–Hg–OH is stable and hardly detaches from the catalyst surface due to the highly endothermic process. A large amount of electron transfer has been found from Hg to the produced OH groups and has little irreversible effect on the Fe3O4(111) surface. On the Feoct2-terminated Fe3O4(111) surface, the Feoct2site is more active than Fetet1site. H2O2decomposition and Hg0oxidation processes are more likely to occur due to that the Feoct2site both contains Fe2+and Fe3+cations. The calculations reveal that Hg0oxidation by the OH radical produced from H2O2is energetically favored. Additionally, Hg0and H2O2co-interaction mechanism on the Fe3O4(111) interface has been investigated on the basis of partial local density of state calculation.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhou Changsong; Song Zijian; Zhang Zhiyue; Yang Hongmin; Wang Ben; Yu Jie; Sun Lushi,Engineering Laboratory of Energy System Process Conversion and Emission Reduction Technology of Jiangsu Province\School of Energy and Mechanical Engineering\China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion\Huazhong University of Science and Technology\China,-,Co-interaction; Density functional theory; Elemental mercury; Fe3O4; H2O2
192.html,"Environmental controls on stable isotopes of precipitation in Lanzhou, China: An enhanced network at city scale","Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation are very sensitive to environmental changes, and can record evolution of water cycle. The Lanzhou city in northwestern China is jointly influenced by the monsoon and westerlies, which is considered as a vital platform to investigate the moisture regime for this region. Since 2011, an observation network of stable isotopes in precipitation was established across the city, and four stations were included in the network. In 2013, six more sampling stations were added, and the enhanced network might provide more meaningful information on spatial incoherence and synoptic process. This study focused on the variations of stable isotopes (δ18O and δD) in precipitation and the environmental controls based on the 1432 samples in this enhanced network from April 2011 to October 2014. The results showed that the precipitation isotopes had great spatial diversity, and the neighboring stations may present large difference in δD and δ18O. Based on the observation at ten sampling sites, an isoscape in precipitation was calculated, and the method is useful to produce isoscape for small domains. The temperature effect and amount effect was reconsidered based on the dataset. Taking meteorological parameters (temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, water vapor pressure and dew point temperature) as variables in a multi-linear regression, the result of coefficients for these meteorological parameters were calculated. Some cases were also involved in this study, and the isotopic characteristics during one event or continuous days were used to understand the environmental controls on precipitation isotopes. © 2017",Chen Fenli; Zhang Mingjun; Wang Shengjie; Qiu Xue; Du Mingxia,College of Geography and Environmental Science\Northwest Normal University\China,-,Lanzhou city; Observation network; Precipitation isotope; Temperature effect
193.html,Highly efficient hydrogen release from formic acid using a graphitic carbon nitride-supported AgPd nanoparticle catalyst,"Bimetallic AgPd nanoparticles with various molar ratios immobilized on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were successfully synthesized via a facile co-reduction approach. The powder XRD, XPS, TEM, EDX, ICP-AES and BET were employed to characterize the structure, size, composition and loading metal electronic states of the AgPd/g-C3N4catalysts. The catalytic property of as-prepared catalysts for the dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA) with sodium formate (SF) as the additive was investigated. The performance of these catalysts, as indicated by the turnover frequency (TOF), depended on the composition of the prepared catalysts. Among all the AgPd/g-C3N4catalysts tested, Ag9Pd91/g-C3N4was found to be an exceedingly high activity for decomposing FA into H2with TOF up to 480 h−1at 323 K. The prepared catalyst is thus a potential candidate for triggering the widespread use of FA for H2storage.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yao Fang; Li Xiao; Wan Chao; Xu Lixin; An Yue; Ye Mingfu; Lei Zhao,School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Anhui University of Technology\China; College of Chemical and Biological Engineering\Zhejiang University\China,-,Dehydrogenation; Formic acid; g-C3N4; Hydrogen storage; Palladium; Silver
194.html,Clustering of gold particles in Au implanted CrN thin films: The effect on the SPR peak position,"We report on the formation of gold particles in 280 nm thin polycrystalline CrN layers caused by Au+ion implantation. The CrN layers were deposited at 150 °C by d.c. reactive sputtering on Si(100) wafers and then implanted at room temperature with 150 keV Au+ions to fluences of 2 × 1016cm−2to 4.1 × 1016cm−2. The implanted layers were analysed by the means of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. The results revealed that the Au atoms are situated in the near-surface region of the implanted CrN layers. At the fluence of 2 × 1016cm−2the formation of Au particles of ∼200 nm in diameter has been observed. With increasing Au ion fluence the particles coalesce into clusters with dimensions of ∼1.7 μm. The synthesized particles show a strong absorption peak associated with the excitation of surface plasmon resonances (SPR). The position of the SPR peak shifted in the range of 426.8–690.5 nm when the Au+ion fluence was varied from 2 × 1016cm−2to 4.1 × 1016cm−2. A correlation of the shift in the peak wavelength caused by the change in the particles size and clustering has been revealed, suggesting that the interaction between Au particles dominate the surface plasmon resonance effect.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,University of Belgrade\Institute of Nuclear Sciences VINČA\Serbia; Institute of Solid State Physics\Friedrich Schiller University Jena\Germany,-,Chromium-nitride; Gold particles; Ion implantation; Surface plasmon resonance effect

198.html,Five-year monitoring of 19 illicit and legal substances of abuse at the inlet of a wastewater treatment plant in Barcelona (NE Spain) and estimation of drug consumption patterns and trends,"Illicit and legal drugs of abuse, including alcohol, continue to be in the focus of many governmental national and international studies due to the important consequences of their consumption at both individual and social level. Estimation of drug use at the community level from the concentrations of the drugs themselves or their major metabolites measured in wastewater has become an increasingly accepted and extended tool, complementary to the methods traditionally used for this purpose. The present work describes the application of this approach, generally known as wastewater epidemiology, to investigate the latest drug consumption patterns and trends in the European city of Barcelona. To this end, a total of 19 selected drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored at the inlet of one of the main wastewater treatment plants of Barcelona every day during one week in March between 2011 and 2015. Analysis of the selected drugs and metabolites in the wastewater samples was performed by means of two methodologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the concentrations obtained were translated into consumption data. In agreement with official records, alcohol, followed by cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds, and methadone were the most consumed drugs. Alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine consumption were on average 18 mL(14 g)/day/inhabitant (> 15), 38 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, and 2.4 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, respectively. As for drug use trends, consumption increased over the 5 years monitored for all drugs, but for heroin and diazepam. Weekly profiles characterized by higher consumption over the weekend as compared to weekdays were observed only for alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA. Extrapolation of the data obtained for the area under study to the national Spanish territory yields consumption figures of 142 t of illicit drugs per year and > 2500 million euro turnover per year in the black market. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Mastroianni Nicola; López-García Ester; Postigo Cristina; Barceló Damià; López de Alda Miren,Water and Soil Quality Research Group\Department of Environmental Chemistry\Spain; Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA)\Parc Científic i Tecnològic de la Universitat de Girona\Spain,-,Alcohol; Drug abuse; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Sewage epidemiology; Wastewater analysis

This is described by the use of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and modified Mars-van Krevelen kinetic models. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics model enabled the determination of adsorption constants of morin and peroxide on the surface of the catalyst, Kmorinand KH, respectively, surface rates k, and the heterogeneity constants on the catalyst surface for morin and peroxide, respectively. The surface rate for oxidation of morin obtained by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was compared to the surface rate obtained using the Mars-van Krevelen model. Both models suggest activation of the substrate on the catalyst surface as depicted by the high surface rates when compared to the rates of disappearance of morin from the solution. However, preliminary findings suggest that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model describes morin oxidation kinetics better than the modified Mars-van Krevelen model. Overall, this work investigates the kinetics of morin oxidation on an oxygen-rich catalyst and provides experimental data fitting with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and the modified Mars-van Krevelen kinetic models.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bingwa Ndzondelelo; Bewana Semakaleng; Haumann Marco; Meijboom Reinout,Department of Chemistry\University of Johannesburg\South Africa; Lehrstuhl für Chemische Reaktionstechnik (CRT)\Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)\Germany,-,Kinetics; Langmuir-Hinshelwood models; Manganese oxide; Mars-van Krevelen; Morin oxidation

However, 21st Dynasty coffins and sarcophagi were never deeply studied with regard to this particular subject (the Amduat), thus representing a gap between New Kingdom and later sources. If, on the one hand, the Amduat displayed on these chests are not 'pure' in the way other sources can provide, then, on the other hand, the originality of its use and its articulation with other iconographical themes are important elements that can improve our knowledge of Late Period funerary religion and the symbolic language used to express it. Additionally, data extracted from these chests could be a valuable cross-reference for information from other sources. The aim of this paper is to present the preliminary results of our study of the iconographic representations of the Amduat seen on approximately 60 coffins and sarcophagi and to highlight the frequency of certain subjects, their location on the objects concerned, and their association with relevant iconography found in other sources. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The SiO2shell layers with moderate dielectric permittivity could effectively mitigate the local field concentration induced by the large mismatch between the dielectric permittivity of BT and PI, which contributes to the enhancement of the breakdown strength of the PI nanocomposite films. As a result, the PI nanocomposite film filled with 3 vol% BT@SiO2nanofibers exhibits a maximal energy density of 2.31 J cm−3under the field of 346 kV/mm, which is 62% over the pristine PI (1.42 J cm−3at 308 kV/mm) and about 200% greater than the best commercial polymer, i.e. biaxially oriented polypropylenes (BOPP) (≈1.2 J cm−3). The thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that the BT@SiO2/PI nanocomposite films have good thermal stability below 500 °C.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Junchuan; Long Yunchen; Sun Ying; Zhang Xueqin; Yang Hong; Lin Baoping,School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Southeast University\China,-,BaTiO3@SiO2nanofibers; Breakdown strength; Dielectric properties; Energy density; Polyimide
201.html,TSEM-based contour analysis as a tool for the quantification of the profile roughness of silica shells on polystyrene core particles,"Core-shell (CS) particles with a polymeric core and a silica shell play an important role in the materials and (bio)analytical sciences. Besides the establishment of reliable synthesis procedures, comprehensive particle characterization is essential for batch-to-batch reproducibility and objective performance assessment across architectures, protocols, and laboratories. Particle characterization with respect to size, size distribution, shell thickness and texture, surface area and roughness or materials composition is commonly conducted with different analytical methods, often on different samples. Our approach uses a dual-mode TSEM/SEM set-up with an EDX detector to obtain a complementary data set with sufficient statistical confidence of one and the same sample on a single instrument. Our protocol reveals information about size, size distribution and shell thickness of the various particles employed from overview images, while an increased field of view (FOV) and high-resolution EDX analysis yields detailed information on shell texture and elemental composition. An image analysis tool was developed to derive and quantify the profile roughness of CS particles from individual beads. Comparison with surface roughness data from AFM showed a similar trend in roughness across the series of particles. Reliable classification into smooth and rough is proposed and roughness changes within different particle batches were tracked systematically. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sarma Dominik; Mielke Johannes; Sahre Mario; Beck Uwe; Hodoroaba Vasile-Dan; Rurack Knut,Chemical and Optical Sensing Division 1.9\Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM)\Germany; Surface Analysis and Interfacial Chemistry Division 6.1\Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM)\Germany; Surface Modification and Measurement Technology Division 6.7\Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM)\Germany,-,Core-shell particles; Electron microscopy; Image analysis; Roughness; Transmission mode

The crystal structures, surface and interface morphologies as well as the optical properties of the obtained TiO2films depending on substrate temperature were studied in detail. A single-crystal anatase TiO2(a-TiO2) film was obtained at the substrate temperature of 550 °C. The epitaxial relationship between the a-TiO2film and MgAl6O10(100) substrate was a-TiO2(001) || MgAl6O10(100) with a-TiO2[100] || MgAl6O10[001]. The a-TiO2film showed an average transmittance of 95.1% in the visible range, and an optical band gap of 3.46 eV. The refractive indexes and extinction coefficients of the obtained TiO2films as a function of wavelength were analyzed. A broad photoluminescence peak centered at 535 nm was observed at room temperature and the corresponding luminescence mechanisms were discussed.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhao Wei; Feng Xianjin; Ma Xiaochen; He Linan; Cao Qiong; Ma Jin,School of Microelectronics\Shandong University\China; BOE Technology Group Co.

203.html,"Estimation of disease burdens on preterm births and low birth weights attributable to maternal fine particulate matter exposure in Shanghai, China","Background Studies have shown that maternal exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) was associated with adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW). However, the burdens of PTB and LBW attributable to PM2.5were rarely evaluated, especially in developing countries. Objectives To estimate the burdens of PTBs and LBWs attributable to outdoor PM2.5in Shanghai, China. Methods We collected annual-average PM2.5concentrations, concentration-response relationships between PM2.5exposure during pregnancy and PTBs and LBWs, rates of PTB and LBW, number of live births, and population sizes in grids of 10 km × 10 km in Shanghai in 2013. Then, they were combined to estimate the odds ratios (ORs), relative risks (RRs), attributable fractions (AFs), and numbers of PTBs and LBWs associated with PM2.5exposure. Results The population-weighted annual-average concentration of PM2.5in Shanghai was 56.19 μg/m3in 2013. According to the first-class limit of PM2.5(15 μg/m3) in the Ambient Air Quality Standards of China, the weighted RRs of PTBs or LBWs associated with PM2.5in Shanghai were 1.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16–1.80] and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.04–1.67), respectively. There might be 32.61% (95% CI: 13.93%–44.42%) or 4160 (95% CI: 1778–5667) PTBs and 23.36% (95% CI: 3.86%–40.02%) or 1882 (95% CI: 311–3224) LBWs attributable to PM2.5exposure. The estimates varied appreciably among different districts of Shanghai. Conclusions Our analysis suggested that outdoor PM2.5air pollution might have led to considerable burdens of PTBs and LBWs in Shanghai, China. © 2017",Liu Anni; Qian Naisi; Yu Huiting; Chen Renjie; Kan Haidong,School of Public Health\Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education\China; Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention\Shanghai\China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Meteorology and Health\Shanghai\China,-,Air pollution; Disease burden; Low birth weight; PM2.5; Preterm birth
204.html,"Chloramphenicol interaction with functionalized biochar in water: sorptive mechanism, molecular imprinting effect and repeatable application","Biochar and functionalized biochar (fBC-1 and fBC-2) were prepared and applied to remove antibiotic chloramphenicol from deionized water, lake water and synthetic wastewater. Results showed that chloramphenicol removal on biochar was pH dependent and maximum sorption occurred at pH 4.0–4.5. The sorption data of chloramphenicol fitted better with the Langmuir isotherm model than the Freundlich isotherm model with the maximum Langmuir sorption capacity of 233 μM g− 1using fBC-2. Chloramphenicol sorption on fBC-2 followed the trend: deionized water > lake water > synthetic wastewater. The presence of humic acid decreased the sorption distribution coefficient (Kd) while the presence of low ionic strength and soil in solution increased Kdvalue significantly. The mechanism of sorption on fBC mainly involved electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions at pH < 2.0; formation of charge assisted hydrogen bond (CAHB) and hydrogen bonds in addition to EDA in the pH 4.0–4.5; and CAHB and EDA interactions at pH > 7.0. Additionally, solvent and thermal regeneration of fBC-2 for repeatable applications showed excellent sorption of chloramphenicol under the same condition, due to the creation of a molecular imprinting effect in fBC-2. Consequently, fBC-2 can be applied with excellent reusability properties to remove chloramphenicol and other similar organic contaminants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ahmed Mohammad Boshir; Zhou John L.; Ngo Huu Hao; Guo Wenshan; Johir Md Abu Hasan; Sornalingam Kireesan,School of Civil and Environmental Engineering\University of Technology Sydney\Australia; Department of Applied Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\University of Rajshahi\Bangladesh,-,Chloramphenicol; Electron-donor interactions; Functionalized biochar; H-bond; Molecular imprinting effect; Reusability
205.html,Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in discharge from drained peatland forests are increasing,"The current understanding, based on previous studies, is that increased discharge nutrient concentrations from boreal peatlands drained for forestry return to similar levels as those of pristine peatlands within about 20 years after their drainage. As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20–30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Nieminen Mika; Sallantaus Tapani; Ukonmaanaho Liisa; Nieminen Tiina M.; Sarkkola Sakari,Natural Resources Institute Finland\Latokartanonkaari 9\Finland; Finnish Environment Institute\Mechelininkatu 34a\Finland,-,Drainage; Hydrochemistry; Peat mineralization; Peat subsidence; Water quality
206.html,Effect of duty cycle on preparation and corrosion behavior of electrodeposited calcium phosphate coatings on AZ91,"In present work, calcium phosphate coatings on AZ91 substrate were prepared by pulse electrodeposition at different duty cycle (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) in the mixed solution of 0.1 M Ca(NO3)2and 0.06 M NH4H2PO4at 60 °C. Phase composition and corrosion behavior of the as-deposited coatings were studied. Results showed that the calcium phosphate coatings had a grass-like structure. As the duty cycle increased, phase composition of the coatings changed from hydroxyapatite (HA) to mixture of HA and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD). The adhesion of strength between the coatings and the substrate were higher than 10 MPa. Potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated that the samples deposited with calcium phosphate coatings exhibited better corrosion resistance as compared with the bare AZ91 alloy.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wu Peng-peng; Zhang Zhong-zhong; Xu Fang-jun; Deng Kun-kun; Nie Kai-bo; Gao Rui,College of Materials Science and Engineering\Taiyuan University of Technology\China; Shanxi Key Laboratory of Advanced Magnesium-Based Materials\Taiyuan University of Technology\China; CNNC Xinneng Nuclear Engineering Co.\Ltd\China,-,Calcium phosphate coating; Corrosion resistance; Duty cycle; Electrochemical deposition
207.html,Scalable creation of gold nanostructures on high performance engineering polymeric substrate,"The article reveals a facile protocol for scalable production of gold nanostructures on a high performance engineering thermoplastic substrate made of polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) for the first time. Firstly, gold thin films with different thicknesses of 2 nm, 4 nm and 6 nm were evaporated on a spin-coated PEN substrate on glass slide in vacuum. Next, the as-evaporated samples were thermally annealed around the glass transition temperature of the PEN substrate, on which gold nanostructures with island-like morphology were created. Moreover, it was found that the initial gold evaporation thickness and annealing atmosphere played an important role in determining the morphology and plasmonic properties of the formulated Au NPs. Interestingly, we discovered that isotropic Au NPs can be easily fabricated on the freestanding PEN substrate, which was fabricated by a cost-effective polymer solution casting method. More specifically, monodispersed Au nanospheres with an average size of ∼60 nm were obtained after annealing a 4 nm gold film covered PEN casting substrate at 220 °C for 2 h in oxygen. Therefore, the scalable production of Au NPs with controlled morphology on PEN substrate would open the way for development of robust flexible nanosensors and optical devices using high performance engineering polyarylene ethers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Jia Kun; Wang Pan; Wei Shiliang; Huang Yumin; Liu Xiaobo,High Temperature Resistant Polymer and Composites Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province\School of Microelectronics and Solid-States Electronics\China,-,Gold nanostructures; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Polyarylene ether nitrile; Thermal annealing
208.html,Effective coating of titania nanoparticles with alumina via atomic layer deposition,"Alumina films were deposited on titania nanoparticles via atomic layer deposition (ALD) in a fluidized bed reactor at 180 °C and 1 bar. Online mass spectrometry was used for real time monitoring of effluent gases from the reactor during each reaction cycle in order to determine the optimal dosing time of precursors. Different oxygen sources were used to see which oxygen source, in combination with trimethyl aluminium (TMA), provides the highest alumina growth per cycle (GPC). Experiments were carried out in 4, 7 and 10 cycles using the optimal dosing time of precursors. Several characterization methods, such as high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), were conducted on the products. Formation of the alumina film was confirmed by EDX mapping and EDX line profiling, FTIR and TEM. When using either water or deuterium oxide as the oxygen source, the thickness of the alumina film was greater than that of ozone. The average GPC measured by TEM for the ALD of TMA with water, deuterium oxide and ozone was about 0.16 nm, 0.15 nm and 0.11 nm, respectively. The average GPC calculated using the mass fraction of aluminum from INAA was close to those measured from TEM images. Excess amounts of precursors lead to a higher average growth of alumina film per cycle due to insufficient purging time. XRD analysis demonstrated that amorphous alumina was coated on titania nanoparticles. This amorphous layer was easily distinguished from the crystalline core in the TEM images. Decrease in the photocatalytic activity of titania nanoparticles after alumina coating was confirmed by measuring degradation of Rhodamine B by ultraviolet irradiation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Multiphase Systems Research Lab.\School of Chemical Engineering\Iran; Delft University of Technology\Faculty of Applied Science\Netherlands; Delft University of Technology\Kavli Institute of Nanoscience\Netherlands; Multi-Phase Mass Transfer & Reaction Engineering Lab\College of Chemical Engineering\China,-,Atomic layer deposition; Coating of titania; Growth per cycle; Oxidizer; Photocatalytic activity
209.html,Experimental investigation of the tip based micro/nano machining,"Based on the self-developed three dimensional micro/nano machining system, the effects of machining parameters and sample material on micro/nano machining are investigated. The micro/nano machining system is mainly composed of the probe system and micro/nano positioning stage. The former is applied to control the normal load and the latter is utilized to realize high precision motion in the xy plane. A sample examination method is firstly introduced to estimate whether the sample is placed horizontally. The machining parameters include scratching direction, speed, cycles, normal load and feed. According to the experimental results, the scratching depth is significantly affected by the normal load in all four defined scratching directions but is rarely influenced by the scratching speed. The increase of scratching cycle number can increase the scratching depth as well as smooth the groove wall. In addition, the scratching tests of silicon and copper attest that the harder material is easier to be removed. In the scratching with different feed amount, the machining results indicate that the machined depth increases as the feed reduces. Further, a cubic polynomial is used to fit the experimental results to predict the scratching depth. With the selected machining parameters of scratching direction d3/d4, scratching speed 5 μm/s and feed 0.06 μm, some more micro structures including stair, sinusoidal groove, Chinese character ‘田’, ‘TJU’ and Chinese panda have been fabricated on the silicon substrate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education\Tianjin University\China; School of Engineering\University of Warwick\United Kingdom,-,Machining parameters; Micro/nano machining; Scratching depth
21.html,The Moon god Iah in ancient Egyptian religion,"In the framework of a religion with such a notorious solar character as that of ancient Egypt, the Moon god Iah ('I'h) is overshadowed by the solar doctrine. Iah is a secondary divinity rarely mentioned in the religious corpora, although his clergy and temple have been documented. Moreover, certain royal and elite personal names were composed with Iah as Iahmes, 'The Moon is born/Born of the Moon', in the Second Intermediate Period and at the beginning of the 18th Dynasty. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of Iah in Egyptian religion and his influence on society from the Old Kingdom to the 18th Dynasty. This study will examine the recitations in the Pyramid Texts, the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead where the deity is mentioned, and will also survey his impact on the social sphere through evidence from anthroponomy. The Moon in ancient Egypt adopted a dual role: As a masculine divinity, he had a prominence which soared at night during the nightlife in funerary confines and was bound to a monthly renascence cycle; as a celestial body, its different phases were associated with certain lunar festivals, well documented in the private funerary inscriptions. In addition, the Moon god did not remain unaltered; instead, his features were adapted to the religious needs of each period. Based on the analysis of the texts, it is revealed that the theological essence of the Moon god Iah and his main functions in a nocturnal religious context were closely related to the renaissance of the deceased. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

210.html,The influence of conditioning film on antifouling properties of the polyurethane film modified by chondroitin sulfate in urine,"The encrustation and induced infection severely impact on the therapeutic effectiveness and service life of urinary stents due to the fast formation of conditioning film on urinary stents after implantation. The composition and properties of conditioning film have great influence on antifouling properties of stent materials. In our previous work, we modified polyurethane films by chondroitin sulfate (PU-CS) with different CS grafting densities to verify its anti-fouling properties. To obtain the in-depth understanding of encrustation on urinary stents, we investigated the impact of the composition and properties of conditioning film on the following inorganic salt deposition and bacteria adhesion in urine. The results showed that quantity of proteins and polysaccharides in conditioning films, and the roughness, water contact angle and zeta potential of PU-CSs covered with corresponding conditioning film decreased with the increase of CS grafting density on PU films.PU-CS(3) with highest CS grafting density (3.70 g/cm2) had the highest bacteria inhibition rate and least inorganic salt deposition among the PU-CSs in artificial urine. Moreover, inorganic salts depositing on the PU-CS(3) were less and smaller than those on other films. Bacteria were not detectable until day 21 in real urine. Meanwhile, the pH value was elevated. The results suggested that the component of conditioning films was more important than other surface properties such as hydrophilicity, zeta potential and roughness for inorganic salt deposition and bacteria adhesion. Moreover, the anti-encrustation properties of the surface was promoted by proteins and inhibited by polysaccharides.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yuan Huihui; Qian Bin; Chen Huaying; Lan Minbo,Shanghai Key Laboratory of Functional Materials Chemistry\School of Chemistry & Molecular Engineering\China; State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering\East China University of Science and Technology\China; School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation\Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)\China,-,Bacteria adhesion; Chondroitin sulfate; Conditioning film; Inorganic salt deposition; Polyurethane modification

Sediment samples were analyzed for trace metals, organic carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), emerging chemicals of concern (ECC) and sterols. Similarly, the biological and biochemical interaction between the reef and its environment was analyzed by the multi-omic tools of next-generation sequencing characterization of the bacterial community and microbial community metabolic profiling. Overall, the trace elements were observed at the lower end of the Australian environmental guideline values at the offshore sites, while higher values were observed for the onshore locations Nickel and copper were observed above the high trigger value threshold at the onshore sites. The levels of PAH were below limits of detection across all sites. However, some of the ECC and sterols were observed at higher concentrations at both onshore and offshore locations, notably, the cholesterol family sterols and 17α-ethynylestradiol. Multi-omic analyses also indicated possible thermal and photo irradiation stressors on the bacterial communities at all the tested sites. The observed populations of γ-proteobacteria were found in combination with an increased pool of fatty acids that indicate fatty acid synthesis and utilisation of the intermediates of the shikimate pathways. This study demonstrates the value of applying a multi-omics approach for ecological assessments, in which a more detailed assessment of physical and chemical contaminants and their impact on the community bacterial biome is obtained. © 2017",-,CSIRO Land & Water\Ecosciences Precinct\Australia; CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere\Ecosciences Precinct\Australia; Faculty of Science\Engineering and Technology\Australia; CSIRO Land & Water\Waite Campus\Australia,-,Chemometrics; Environmental health; Hormones; Metabolomics; Metagenomics
212.html,Fractal dimension of large aggregates under different flocculation conditions,"The two-dimensional fractal dimension (Df) of large aggregates of kaolin (> 540 μm) during the shear flocculation process for kaolin solution was investigated using non-intrusive in situ image-based acquisition system. Separate experiments were also carried out for three different sized sub-ranges of large aggregates (0.540–1.125 mm; 1.125–1.750 mm; 1.750–2.375 mm). Digital images were taken at a frequency of 10 Hz for 10 s for each different pairs of gradients of velocity (Gf) of 20 and 60 s− 1and flocculation times of 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 30; 60; 120 and 180 min. For the same conditions, particle size distribution (PSD) was also determined. Under the investigated conditions, the lowest Gfproduced the greatest Df(1.69) at a flocculation time of 30 min for the whole range of aggregates. Also, the evolution of the longest length of aggregate (l) and Dfwith time, showed that the dynamic steady-state was reached at different times for each shear rate and l ranges. However, Dfvaried for each size sub-range (ca. 1.1 to 1.8). Finally, the behavior of the aggregate structure may be understood by the predominance of different aggregation mechanisms such as cluster-cluster for Gfof 60 s− 1and particle-cluster for Gfof 20 s− 1. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Moruzzi Rodrigo B.; de Oliveira André L.; da Conceição Fabiano T.; Gregory John; Campos Luiza C.,Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP)\Instituto de Geociências e Ciências Exatas\Brazil; Department of Civil\Environmental and Geomatic Engineering\United Kingdom,-,Aggregates; Flocculation; Fractal dimension; Shear rate
213.html,Analysis of arrayed nanocapacitor formed on nanorods by flow-rate interruption atomic layer deposition,Flow-rate interruption (FRI) atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was adopted to fabricate AZO/Al2O3/AZO thin film on a ZnO nanorod array template at low temperature. The high quality amorphous dielectric Al2O3layer was deposited at 50 °C. The template with an average of 0.73 μm in length was made by a simple hydrothermal method on a c−plane sapphire with an AZO seed layer. Using Polystyrene (PS) microspheres were served as a mask to form vertical and well-aligned ZnO nanostructures. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show ALD to have achieved good step coverage and thickness control in the thin films structure coating. The capacitance density of the arrayed template nanocapacitor increased more than 100% than those of the thin film capacitor at an applied frequency of 10 kHz. These results suggest that the ZnO-arrayed template could enhance energy storage capability by providing significant surface area. This structure provides a concept for high surface-area nanocapacitor applications.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.,Lin Bo-Cheng; Ku Ching-Shun; Lee Hsin-Yi; Chakroborty Subhendu; Wu Albert T.,Department of Chemical and Material Engineering\National Central University\Taiwan; National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center\Hsinchu Science Park\Taiwan,-,Atomic layer deposition; Hydrothermal growth; Nanocapacitor; Nanosphere lithography; ZnO nanorod arrays
214.html,Application of phytoscreening to three hazardous waste sites in Arizona,"The great majority of prior phytoscreening applications have been conducted in humid and temperate environments wherein groundwater is relatively shallow (~ 1–6 m deep). The objective of this research is to evaluate its use in semi-arid environments for sites with deeper groundwater (> 10 m). To that end, phytoscreening is applied to three chlorinated-solvent hazardous-waste sites in Arizona. Contaminant concentrations were quantifiable in tree-tissue samples collected from two of the sites (Nogales, Park-Euclid). Contaminant concentrations were detectable, but not quantifiable, for the third site. Tree-tissue concentrations of tetrachloroethene (PCE) ranged from approximately 400–5000 ug/kg wet weight for burrobrush, cottonwood, palo verde, and velvet mesquite at the Nogales site. In addition to standard trunk-core samples, leaf samples were collected to test the effectiveness of a less invasive sampling method. Leaf-sample concentrations were quantifiable, but several times lower than the corresponding core-sample concentrations. Comparison of results obtained for the test sites to those reported in the literature suggest that tree species is a major factor mediating observed results. One constraint faced for the Arizona sites was the relative scarcity of mature trees available for sampling, particularly in areas adjacent to industrial zones. The results of this study illustrate that phytoscreening can be used effectively to characterize the presence of groundwater contamination for semi-arid sites with deeper groundwater. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Duncan Candice M.; Mainhagu Jon; Virgone Kayla; Ramírez Denise Moreno; Brusseau Mark L.,Environmental Science and Technology Department\College of Agriculture and Natural Resources\United States; Soil\Water and Environmental Science Department\United States; Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences Department\School of Earth and Environmental Sciences\United States; Superfund Research Program - Community Engagement Core\Dean Carter Binational Center for Environmental Health Sciences\United States,-,Phytoscreening; Site characterization; Tree core samples; VOCs
215.html,"Assessment of the bioavailability, bioaccessibility and transfer of heavy metals in the soil-grain-human systems near a mining and smelting area in NW China","Elucidating the transfer behaviour of heavy metals from soils to grains and ultimately to humans is of great significance for both human health risk assessment and pollution control. In this study, the bioavailability of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr and Ni) in farmland soils and bioaccessibility in grains (spring wheat, maize and rice) were determined to elaborate transfer dynamics in the soil-grain-human systems near a mining and smelting area in the Dongdagou watershed, Baiyin district, Gansu province, NW China. The results showed that Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations in soils were elevated compared to background levels, while Cr and Ni concentrations were relatively low throughout the region. High levels of bioavailable soil Cd were found using both EDTA and CH3COOH extraction methods. Mean concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in spring wheat grains and the Cd and Cr concentrations in maize grains exceeded the relevant maximum levels for pollutants according to the Chinese national standards for food safety. Except for Ni (41.90%) and Pb (31.39%), heavy metal bioaccessibility was relatively low in grains, ranging from 10.80% (Cd) to 17.18% (Zn). CH3COOH-extracted Cd, Pb and Ni, EDTA-extracted Zn, and total Cu in soils were the best indices for evaluation of uptake in grains (R2= 0.54–0.91, p < 0.001). Internal exposure doses of Cd and Ni in humans from spring wheat grain consumption was predicted by the linear correlations between bioaccessible and total metal concentrations (R2= 0.61 and 0.67; p < 0.001). The results from this study provide sufficient data and theoretical support for the use of these methods for local pollution prevention and control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Bailin; Ai Shiwei; Zhang Wenya; Huang Dejun; Zhang Yingmei,Gansu Key Laboratory of Biomonitoring and Bioremediation for Environmental Pollution\School of Life Sciences\China,-,Agroecosystem; Bioaccessibility; Bioavailability; Heavy metals; In vitro stimulated digestion; Transfer behaviour
216.html,Quaternary schematics for property engineering of CdSe thin films,"The synthesis of quaternary Cd1-xZnxSySe1-y(0 ≤ x = y ≤ 0.35) thin films was done through indigenously developed chemical solution growth process. As-obtained thin films were subjected to the physical, chemical, structural and optical characterizations. The nearly hydrophobic nature of the as-deposited films except binary CdSe was observed through the wettability studies. The colorimetric studies supported a change in physical color attributes. The elemental analysis done confirmed the formation of Cd(Zn, S)Se and the chemical states of constituent elements as Cd2+, Zn2+, S2−and Se2−. Structural assessment suggested the formation of the polycrystalline quaternary phase of the hexagonal wurtzite structure. The Raman spectroscopy was also employed for the confirmation studies on Cd1-xZnxSySe1-ythin films. Morphological observations indicated microstructural transformation from an aggregated bunch of nano-sized globular grains into a rhomboid network of petal/flakes like crystallites. The atomic force micrographs (AFM) revealed the enhancement in the hillock structures. From advanced AFM characterizations, we observed that the CdSe thin film has leptokurtic (Sku= 3.23) surface, whereas, quaternary Cd(Zn, S)Se films have platykurtic (Sku< 3) surface. The orientation of the surface morphology was observed through the angular spectrum studies. The optical absorption studies revealed direct allowed transition for the films with a continuous modulation of the energy bandgap from 1.8 eV to 2.31 eV.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Thin Film & Solar Studies Research Laboratory\Solapur University\India; Electrotechnical Institute\Division of Electrotechnology & Materials Science\Poland; Division of Physics & Semiconductor Science\Dongguk University\South Korea; Department of Physics\Savitribai Phule Pune University\India,-,AFM; Chemical synthesis; Colorimetry; Raman; SEM; XPS
217.html,Quantitative estimation of 21st-century urban greenspace changes in Chinese populous cities,"Understanding the spatiotemporal changes of urban greenspace is a critical requirement for supporting urban planning and maintaining the function of urbanities. Although plenty of previous studies have attempted to estimate urban greenspace changes in China, there still remain shortcomings such as inconsistent surveying procedures and insufficient spatial resolution and city samples. Using cloud-free Landsat image composites in circa years 2000 and 2014, and Defense Meteorological Program Satellite Program's Operational Line-scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime lights dataset, we quantitatively estimated the urban greenspace changes regarding both administrative divisions and urban core boundaries across 98 Chinese populous cities. Results showed that a consistent decline of urban greenspace coverage was identified at both old and new urban areas in the majority of analyzed cities (i.e., 81.63% of cities regarding the administrative boundaries, and 86.73% of cities regarding the urban core boundaries). Partial correlation analysis also revealed that total urban greenspace area shrank as a linear function of the core urban expansion (R2= 0.28, P < 0.001), and a significant correlation was confirmed between population change and urban greenspace change across those Chinese populous cities included in this study (R2= 0.11, P < 0.001). © 2017",Chen Bin; Nie Zhen; Chen Ziyue; Xu Bing,Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modelling\Department of Earth System Science\China; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science\College of Global Change and Earth System Science\China; Department of Geography\University of Utah\United States,-,Greenspace changes; Remote sensing; Urban core; Urbanization
218.html,Electrical current at micro-/macro-scale of undoped and nitrogen-doped MWPECVD diamond films,"Chemical, structural, morphological and micro-/macro-electrical properties of undoped and nitrogen-(N-)doped diamond films are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) and two points technique for I–V characteristics, respectively. The characterization results are very useful to examine and understand the relationship among these properties. The effect of the nitrogen incorporation in diamond films is investigated through the evolution of the chemical, structural, morphological and topographical features and of the electrical behavior. The distribution of the electrical current is first assessed at millimeter scale on the surface of diamond films and then at micrometer scale on small regions in order to establish the sites where the carriers preferentially move. Specifically, the SCM images indicate a non-uniform distribution of carriers on the morphological structures mainly located along the grain boundaries. A good agreement is found by comparing the electrical currents at the micro- and macro-scale. This work aims to highlight phenomena such as photo- and thermionic emission from N-doped diamond useful for microelectronic engineering. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,P.LAS.M.I Lab@CNR-NANOTEC\Via Amendola 122/D\Italy; Dipartimento di Chimica\Università degli Studi\Italy,-,Diamond films; Electrical current at micro-/macro-scale; Grain boundaries; Grains; Nitrogen doping; Scanning capacitance microscopy

To clarify the effects of changes in land use on carbon dioxide emissions, we measured oxidative peat decomposition (PD) at different stages of disturbance at three sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia: an undrained peat swamp forest (UF), a heavily drained peat swamp forest (DF), and a drained and burned ex-forest (DB). PD exhibited seasonality, being less in the wet season and greater in the dry season. From February 2014 to December 2015, mean PD (± SE) were 1.90 ± 0.19, 2.30 ± 0.33, and 1.97 ± 0.25 μmol m− 2s− 1at UF, DF, and DB, respectively. The groundwater level (GWL) was a major controlling factor of PD at all sites. At UF and DF, PD and GWL showed significant quadratic relationships. At DB, PD and GWL showed significant positive and negative relationships during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Using these relationships, we estimated annual PD from GWL data for 2014 and 2015 as 698 and 745 g C m− 2yr− 1at UF (mean GWL: − 0.23 and − 0.39 m), 775 and 825 g C m− 2yr− 1at DF (− 0.55 and − 0.59 m), and 646 and 748 g C m− 2yr− 1at DB (− 0.22 and − 0.62 m), respectively. The annual PD was significantly higher in DF than in UF or DB, in both years. Despite the very dry conditions, the annual PD values at these sites were much lower than those reported for tropical peat at plantations (e.g., oil palm, rubber, and acacia). The differences in the relationship between PD and GWL indicate that separate estimations are required for each type of land. Moreover, our results suggest that PD can be enhanced by drainage both in forests and at burned sites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Itoh Masayuki; Okimoto Yosuke; Hirano Takashi; Kusin Kitso,Center for Southeast Asian Studies\Kyoto University\Japan; Research Faculty of Agriculture\Hokkaido University\Japan; CIMTROP\University of Palangkaraya\Indonesia,-,Drainage; Land-use change; Oxidative peat decomposition; Trenching; Tropical peat
22.html,Blue painted pottery from a mid-18th Dynasty royal mud-brick structure in northwest Saqqara,"Blue painted pottery is one of the most characteristic ceramic types in New Kingdom Egypt, dating from the mid 18th Dynasty with the reign of Amenophis II, to the mid 20th Dynasty during the reign of Ramesses IV. One of the largest deposits of blue painted pottery dating to the mid 18th Dynasty was found from the site in northwest Saqqara, especially from a royal mud-brick structure. The blue painted pottery from this structure provides some clues to the understanding of a finer chronology of blue painted pottery in the mid 18th Dynasty, which still remains uncertain due to the lack of contextualized data. This paper aims to examine the chronology of the mentioned blue painted pottery in order to understand its development in the mid 18th Dynasty, during the reigns of Amenophis II and Tuthmosis IV, which correspond to the earliest phase of its production. The examination on the basis of the mentioned blue painted pottery has revealed some aspects of development in the mid 18th Dynasty. The transition of motifs, painting techniques, and fabrics indicate that the blue painted pottery gradually proceeded towards mass-production in the New Kingdom. The motifs are transferred from realistic to formalized representations. The painting techniques are altered as well: The decoration was carefully executed piece-by-piece in the reigns of Amenophis II and Tuthmosis IV, while the decorations were conducted without great care, using wheel or turntable, from the reign of Amenophis III. The Marl clay fabric was principally used in the reigns of Amenophis II and Tuthmosis IV, whilst the use of Nile silt fabric was gradually increased from the reign of Amenophis III and predominantly in Amarna. Also, the regional variations of blue painted pottery from Memphis and Thebes can be recognized. If the workshops existed in two areas, one of the largest deposits from northwest Saqqara implies that the center of manufacturing was located in the Memphite area in the reigns of Amenophis II and Tuthmosis IV, although the manufacturing center was subsequently moved to Malkata, in Thebes, in the reign of Amenophis III, and Amarna in the reign of Akhenaten. The quality of decorations, which is higher than contemporary Theban blue painted pottery, supports this idea. The decorative skills as well as the quality of the blue painted pottery from northwest Saqqara can be reasonably associated with some of the most skilled artists in New Kingdom Egypt. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

220.html,An underappreciated hotspot of antibiotic resistance: The groundwater near the municipal solid waste landfill,"Landfills are so far the most common practice for the disposals of municipal solid waste (MSW) worldwide. Since MSW landfill receives miscellaneous wastes, including unused/expired antibiotics and bioactive wastes, it gradually becomes a huge potential bioreactor for breeding antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in landfill can flow to the environment through leakage of landfill leachate and pose a risk to public health. Using high throughput quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (HT-qPCR), we investigated the prevalence, diversity of ARGs and its association with various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in MSW landfill groundwater. Totally 171 unique ARGs (belonging to 9 ARG types, encompassing 3 major resistance mechanisms) and 8 MGEs (6 transposase genes, and 2 integron-integrase genes) were identified. The normalized abundance of ARG was ranging from 0.24 to 5.66 copies/cell with multidrug, beta-lactams and tetracycline resistance genes being the most abundant ARG types. The co-occurrence pattern and significant correlation between MGEs and ARGs, indicated that MGEs may play an important role in the persistence and proliferation of ARGs. A Mantel test and Procrustes analysis suggested that ARG profiles were significantly correlated with bacterial community. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) further demonstrated that bacterial community shifts contribute 65.8% of the total ARG variations. Additionally network analysis revealed that 15 bacterial taxa at family level might be the potential hosts of ARGs. These findings provide evidence that groundwater near MSW landfill is an underappreciated hotspot of antibiotic resistance and contribute to the spread of ARGs via the flowing contaminated groundwater. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chen Qing-Lin; Li Hu; Zhou Xin-Yuan; Zhao Yi; Su Jian-Qiang; Zhang Xian; Huang Fu-Yi,Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health\Institute of Urban Environment\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\19A Yuquan Road\China; Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences\Faculty of Science\Denmark,-,Antibiotic resistance; Groundwater; HT-qPCR; Network analysis

In the present study, SWIFD structuring of CIGS solar cell stacks was investigated. The rear side of the polyimide was irradiated with a KrF-Excimer laser. The laser-induced ablation process generates a traverse shock wave, and the interaction of the shock wave with the layer-substrate interface results in a delamination process. The effect of a water confinement on the SWIFD process was studied where the rear side of the substrate was covered with a ∼2 mm thick water layer. The resultant surface morphology was analysed and discussed. At a sufficient number of laser pulses N and laser fluences Φ, the CIGS layer can be selectively removed from the Mo back contact. The water confinement, as well as the increasing laser beam size A0and N, results in the reduction of the necessary minimal laser fluence Φth. Further, the delaminated CIGS area increased with increasing Φ, N, and A0.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lorenz Pierre; Zagoranskiy Igor; Ehrhardt Martin; Han Bing; Bayer Lukas; Zimmer Klaus,Leibniz-Institut für Oberflächenmodifizierung e.

The Raman spectroscopic investigation was carried out in a frequency range of 100–2000 cm−1, and the second-order Raman modes were observed at room temperature. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) results revealed that SrTiO3-δsamples had evident EPR signals that increased significantly with oxygen-vacancy concentrations. The incorporation of oxygen vacancies was found to decrease the thermal resistivity. Besides, the electrical sensing measurements showed that sensors based on SrTiO2.925(STO1) and SrTiO2.875(STO2) exhibited semiconductor behavior, while SrTiO2.75-based sensor (STO3) revealed the introduction of a metallic behavior at low temperature. Furthermore, these measurements confirmed that the resistivity increased after the introduction of the ethanol gas, which indicates that our samples can be considered as sensors for ethanol gas detection. The formation of oxygen vacancies under ethanol exposure at the surface of SrTiO3-δsensors was evaluated by photoluminescence.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Laboratoire de Physique Appliquée\Faculté des Sciences\Tunisia; I3N and Physics Department\University of Aveiro\Portugal,-,EPR; Gas-sensor; Oxygen vacancies; Raman; SrTiO3
223.html,Application and validation of a new approach for modelling benthic invertebrate dispersal: First colonisation of a former open sewer system,"Within a heavily modified catchment, formerly polluted streams are now free of untreated wastewater. Additionally, the morphology of streams has been improved by physical habitat restoration. Both water quality and structural improvements offered a unique opportunity to investigate the recolonisation of restored sections by benthic macroinvertebrates. As dispersal is a key mechanism for recolonisation, we developed a method to predict the dispersal of 18 aquatic insect taxa to 35,338 river sections (section length: 2 m) within the catchment. Source populations of insect taxa were sampled at 33 sites. In addition, 14 morphologically restored sites were sampled and constituted the validation dataset. We applied a “least-cost” modelling approach within a raster-based GIS model, combining taxon-specific aquatic and terrestrial dispersal capabilities with the “friction” that physical migration barriers impose on dispersal of aquatic and terrestrial stages. This taxon-specific modelling approach was compared to a conservative modelling approach, assuming a Euclidean distance of 5 km as the maximum dispersal distance for any source population regardless of dispersal barriers. Least-cost modelling showed a significantly better performance in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR) and true predicted absences (specificity), with on average 37% points higher CCR and 42% points higher specificity. Sensitivity was 18% points lower. At 71% of the validation sites, recolonisation was predicted with at least a modest goodness of fit (CCR > 70%). Conversely, the conservative modelling approach achieved a modest goodness of fit for only 14% of the validation sites. For 44% of the taxa, least-cost modelling showed a high CCR (= 100%), whereas the conservative approach showed a high CCR for none of the taxa. Our approach can help water managers select appropriate sites for restoration to increase recolonisation and biological recovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sondermann Martin; Gies Maria; Hering Daniel; Winking Caroline; Feld Christian K.,Department of Aquatic Ecology\Faculty of Biology\Germany; Science Support Centre\University of Duisburg-Essen\Germany; Centre of Water and Environmental Research\University of Duisburg-Essen\Germany; Emschergenossenschaft/Lippeverband\Kronprinzenstrasse 24\Germany,-,Benthos; Dispersal; Fresh waters; Modelling/statistics; Restoration

After analyzing the relative sensitivity of the individual phage-displayed peptides, we subsequently developed and optimized both a phage enzyme immunoassay (P-ELISA) and a phage chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (P-CLEIA) to improve the sensitivity and linear range of imidaclothiz assays. The P-CLEIA (50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 0.86 ng mL− 1, linear range of 0.13–5.84 ng mL− 1) was more sensitive and had a wider linear range compared to the P-ELISA (IC50of 1.45 ng mL− 1, linear range of 0.55–3.82 ng mL− 1). Besides, the sensitivities of the P-ELISA and P-CLEIA were increased by > 4-fold and 8-fold, respectively as compared to homologous immunoassays developed using the same monoclonal antibody. Neither method had significant cross-reactivity with the analogues of imidaclothiz except for imidacloprid. Recoveries of the P-ELISA and P-CLEIA for imidaclothiz in paddy water, soil, cabbage, rice, apple, pakchoi, pear and tomato samples were 72.3–101.3% and 73.9–102.6%, respectively.

226.html,Heterojunction of n-type Sr2TiO4with p-type Bi5O7I with enhanced photocatalytic activity under irradiation of simulated sunlight,"In this study, n-type Sr2TiO4and p-type Bi5O7I, which have identical layered structures, were coupled and loaded with Ag to form a heterojunction photocatalyst. The synthesized Ag-loaded Bi5O7I/Sr2TiO4heterojunction composite showed higher photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye under irradiation of simulated sunlight than did a bare Sr2TiO4sample. X-ray diffraction, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that under alkaline conditions, bismuth ions penetrate into the Bi5O7I/Sr2TiO4heterojunction and replace titanium ions owing to pH changes and the identical layered structures of Bi5O7I and Sr2TiO4, thus causing a reduction in the band-gap energies. Loading of Ag nanoparticles as a co-catalyst onto the Sr2TiO4surface did not yield a p-n heterojunction or cause any improvement in the photocatalytic degradation activity. However, owing to the p-n junction, the internal built-in electric field within the space charge region at the Bi5O7I/Sr2TiO4interface, and the electron-capture ability of Ag and localized surface plasmon resonance effect, the photo-excited electrons and holes separated and migrated effectively and the photocatalytic activity increased significantly. These results reveal that the Ag-loaded Bi5O7I/Sr2TiO4heterojunction can serve as a promising photocatalyst.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hu Chechia; Chen Tsz-Shin; Huang Hui-Xin,Department of Chemical Engineering and R&D Center for Membrane Technology\Chung Yuan Christian University\Taiwan,-,Ag loading; Bi5O7I; Heterojunction; Photocatalyst; Sr2TiO4

228.html,Single-layer graphene/titanium oxide cubic nanorods array/FTO heterojunction for sensitive ultraviolet light detection,"In this study, we report on the fabrication of a sensitive ultraviolet photodetector (UVPD) by simply transferring single-layer graphene (SLG) on rutile titanium oxide cubic nanorod (TiO2NRs) array. The cubic TiO2NRs array with strong light trapping effect was grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass through a hydrothermal approach. The as-assembled UVPD was very sensitive to UV light illumination, but virtually blind to white light illumination. The responsivity and specific detectivity were estimated to be 52.1 A/W and 4.3 × 1012Jones, respectively. What is more, in order to optimize device performance of UVPD, a wet-chemistry treatment was then employed to reduce the high concentration of defects in TiO2NRs during hydrothermal growth. It was found that the UVPD after treatment showed obvious decrease in sensitivity, but the response speed (rise time: 80 ms, fall time: 160 ms) and specific detectivity were substantially increased. It is also found that the speicific detectivity was imporoved by six-fold to 3.2 × 1013Jones, which was the best result in comparison with previously reported TiO2nanostructures or thin film based UVPDs. This totality of this study shows that the present SLG/TiO2NR/FTO UVPD may find potential application in future optoelectronic devices and systems.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liang Feng-Xia; Wang Jiu-Zhen; Wang Yi; Lin Yi; Liang Lin; Gao Yang; Luo Lin-Bao,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Hefei University of Technology\China; School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics\Hefei University of Technology\China,-,Light trapping effect; MSM junction; Responsivity; UV light photodetector; Wide bandgap semiconductor
229.html,Assessing recovery of stream insects from pesticides using a two-patch metapopulation model,"Pesticides can exert lethal and sublethal effects on streams organisms. Field studies have shown that non-polluted upstream patches promote population recovery from such effects. Nevertheless, the dynamics and potential carryover effects on the upstream patch are largely unknown. We used a metapopulation model with 2 patches to simulate lethal and sublethal effects on the downstream population of an insect with one generation per year, which was structured into early and late instars aquatic life stages, and an adult terrestrial life stage. We examined the implications for the recovery time of a range of scenarios covering different pesticide effect combinations, migration and exposure types. We found that recovery time responded most strongly to a reduction in reproduction in terms of the reduction of the intrinsic growth rate during the early instar aquatic life stage. For 60 of 96 scenarios with pesticide exposure in consecutive years, no recovery occurred within one year if the intrinsic growth rate was reduced by 50% or more. Without migration between patches (32 scenarios), the polluted downstream population went extinct in 5 of these scenarios. Migration lead overall to slightly faster recovery, albeit this was scenario dependent, but also to a carryover of the pesticide effect from the polluted downstream to the non-polluted upstream patch (up to 25% reduction in the minimal population size). A sensitivity analysis revealed that recovery time was most sensitive to the parameters length of the intrinsic growth phase during early instar aquatic life stage and to migration mortality of the late instar aquatic larvae, and least sensitive to the adult emigration rate and timing of pesticide application. Our study highlights the important role of sublethal effects for population responses to pesticides and that migration buffers against effects, but also carries effects over to non-polluted patches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Schäfer Ralf B.; Kühn Bernhard; Hauer Larissa; Kattwinkel Mira,Institute for Environmental Sciences\University Koblenz-Landau\Germany; Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment\University of Oldenburg\Germany; UDATA GmbH\Hindenburgstrasse 1\Germany,-,Dispersal; Migration; Recolonisation; Sublethal effects; Toxicants

In this work, we propose hybrid ultrasonic vibration polishing method to improve surface quality of microcraters produced by femtosecond laser irradiation on cemented carbide. The laser caused rough surfaces are significantly smoothened after ultrasonic vibration polishing due to the strong collision effect of diamond particles on the surfaces. 3D morphology, SEM and AFM analysis has been conducted to characterize surface morphology and topography. Results indicate that the minimal surface roughness of Ra 7.60 nm has been achieved on the polished surfaces.

However, when used directly, chitosan particles had small surface area and weak mechanical strength which is unfavorable to metal adsorption and reused. Besides, it cannot be easily recycled that may cause a secondary pollution. In this paper, CS and layered silicate rectorite (REC) were fully mixed and the mixtures were subsequently electrosprayed nano-sized spheres, which were immobilized on the surface of electrospun polystyrene (PS) mats for metal adsorption. The morphology analysis taken from SEM confirmed that CS-REC nanospheres were loaded on the surface of PS fibrous mats. Small Angle X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the interlayer distance of REC in composite mats was enlarged by the intercalation of CS chains; such structure meant bigger surface area which was helpful for metal adsorption. The data of contact angle implied that PS mats coated with CS-REC nanospheres exhibited better hydrophilicity than PS mats, which was conductive to adsorption rate. Besides, the copper ions adsorption of composite mats was tested at different conditions including the adsorption time, the initial pH and the initial concentration of copper ion. The results demonstrated that PS mats coated with CS-REC nanospheres had the adsorption capacity up to 134 mg/g. In addition, the addition of REC containing Ca2+could also improve the metal adsorption because of cation exchange. The desorption assay indicated that PS mats immobilized with CS and CS-REC still kept high adsorption ability which retained 74% and 78% after three adsorption-desorption cycles.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tu Hu; Huang Mengtian; Yi Yang; Li Zhenshun; Zhan Yingfei; Chen Jiajia; Wu Yang; Shi Xiaowen; Deng Hongbing; Du Yumin,Hubei International Scientific and Technological Cooperation Base of Sustainable Resource and Energy\Hubei Key Lab of Biomass Resource Chemistry and Environmental Biotechnology\China; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Guangxi Key Laboratory of Petrochemical Resource Processing and Process Intensification Technology\China; College of Life Science\Yangtze University\China,-,Chitosan; Electrospray; Electrospun; Metal adsorption; Rectorite
232.html,Effect of calcination temperature on formaldehyde oxidation performance of Pt/TiO2nanofiber composite at room temperature,"Catalytic oxidation at room temperature over well-designed catalysts is an environmentally friendly method for the abatement of indoor formaldehyde (HCHO) pollution. Herein, nanocomposites of platinum (Pt) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanofibers with various phase compositions were prepared by calcining the electrospun TiO2precursors at different temperatures and subsequently depositing Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the TiO2through a NaBH4-reduction process. The phase compositions and structures of Pt/TiO2can be easily controlled by varying the calcination temperature. The Pt/TiO2nanocomposites showed a phase-dependent activity towards the catalytic HCHO oxidation. Pt/TiO2containing pure rutile phase showed enhanced activity with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.6 min−1(for a calcination temperature of 800 °C) as compared to those containing the anatase phase or mixed phases. Density functional theory calculation shows that TiO2nanofibers with pure rutile phase have stronger adsorption ability to Pt atoms than anatase phase, which favors the reduction of Pt over rutile phase TiO2, leading to higher contents of metallic Pt in the nanocomposite. In addition, the Pt/TiO2with rutile phase possesses more abundant oxygen vacancies, which is conducive to the activation of adsorbed oxygen. Consequently, the Pt/rutile-TiO2nanocomposite exhibited better catalytic activity towards HCHO oxidation at room temperature.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Feiyan; Le Yao; Cheng Bei; Jiang Chuanjia,State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing\Wuhan University of Technology\China; Department of Construction and Materials Engineering\Hubei University of Education\China,-,Catalytic formaldehyde oxidation; Density functional theory; Oxygen vacancy; Phase structure; Titanium dioxide

The list of compounds amenable to the methods includes different therapeutic classes belonging to antibiotics, stimulants, antidepressants, mucolytics, and antiparasites. The method involves concentration and clean up by an offline solid phase extraction SPE followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The recovery of the target compounds from water samples was most efficient on Waters Oasis HLB SPE cartridge, while acetonitrile/water (60/40) was shown to be the most suitable solvent for desorbing the compounds from SPE. In addition, acidification of samples prior to SPE was optimized to enhance the recovery of the compounds. In terms of method validation, the recoveries of analytes ranged from 68% to 134%. Repeatability and intermediate precision were < 11% and 14%, respectively. The method detection limits ranged from 2.3 ng L− 1to 94.3 ng L− 1. An optimized method was applied in a monitoring program to study the occurrence of pharmaceuticals to more than hundred samples collected from rivers, lakes, fountains, and wells overall Lebanon from April to June 2016. Caffeine, erythromycin and its degradation forms, were the most frequently detected compounds at levels reaching > 10,000 ng L− 1and 2000 ng L− 1, respectively. Moreover, bacterial analysis showed that the samples were contaminated by Escherichia coli (23%), intestinal Enterococcus (48%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%). Therefore, in order to evaluate if a correlation exists between finding antibiotics in water samples and the development of resistant-bacteria, an antimicrobial susceptibility test was conducted to the identified isolates using disk diffusion method. Multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains in both intestinal Enterococcus and E. coli were evident in many water samples, while P. aeruginosa was resistant to only one studied antibiotic. © 2017",Mokh Samia; El Khatib Mohammad; Koubar Mohamad; Daher Zeina; Al Iskandarani Mohamad,National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS)\Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission (LAEC)\Lebanon; Faculty of Public Health I\Lebanese University\Lebanon,-,Antibiotics; LC/MS/MS; Multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Natural water sources; Pharmaceuticals; Solid phase extraction
234.html,Molecular layer deposition of polyurethane—Polymerisation at the very contact to native aluminium and copper,"Thin layers of polyurethane monomers (diol, triol, diisocyanate) are deposited from gas phase onto native aluminium and copper surfaces. According to infrared external reflection absorption spectra both alcohols undergo only weak physical interactions with both metals. The diisocyanate on the other hand reveals resistance against desorption and rich new spectral features indicate strong adhesion. Preparation of urethane layers by sequential deposition of diisocyanate and diol yields urethane linkages. Urethane is formed faster on Cu than on Al. Scanning force microscopy reveals heterogeneous layers with metal dependent morphology. They show poor resistance against tetrahydrofuran rinsing i.e. most part of the formed urethane containing molecules are removed. Nevertheless, a residue of molecules sticks on the metal. It contains strongly adsorbed isocyanates and few isocyanate units which are bonded to diol units via urethane links. Further improvement of the molecular layer deposition is necessary to achieve well-crosslinked polyurethane layers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fug Frank; Petry Adrien; Jost Hendrik; Ahmed Aisha; Zamanzade Mohammad; Possart Wulff,Chair for Adhesion and Interphases in Polymers\Saarland University\Germany; Chair for Materials Science and Methods\Saarland University\Germany,-,Infrared spectroscopy; Molecular layer deposition; Native metal; Polyurethane
235.html,Drug residues in urban water: A database for ecotoxicological risk management,"Human-use drug residues (DR) are only partially eliminated by waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), so that residual amounts can reach natural waters and cause environmental hazards. In order to properly manage these hazards in the aquatic environment, a database is made available that integrates the concentration ranges for DR, which cause adverse effects for aquatic organisms, and the temporal variations of the ecotoxicological risks. To implement this database for the ecotoxicological risk assessment (ERA database), the required information for each DR is the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs), along with the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). The risk assessment is based on the ratio between the PNECs and the PECs. Adverse effect data or PNECs have been found in the publicly available literature for 45 substances. These ecotoxicity test data have been extracted from 125 different sources. This ERA database contains 1157 adverse effect data and 287 PNECs. The efficiency of this ERA database was tested with a data set coming from a simultaneous survey of WWTPs and the natural environment. In this data set, 26 DR were searched for in two WWTPs and in the river. On five sampling dates, concentrations measured in the river for 10 DR could pose environmental problems of which 7 were measured only downstream of WWTP outlets. From scientific literature and measurements, data implementation with unit homogenisation in a single database facilitates the actual ecotoxicological risk assessment, and may be useful for further risk coming from data arising from the future field survey. Moreover, the accumulation of a large ecotoxicity data set in a single database should not only improve knowledge of higher risk molecules but also supply an objective tool to help the rapid and efficient evaluation of the risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Destrieux Doriane; Laurent François; Budzinski Hélène; Pedelucq Julie; Vervier Philippe; Gerino Magali,Acceptables Avenirs\20 rue Hermés\France; National Institute of the Agronomic Research (INRA)\Toulouse\France; Oceanic and Continental Environment and Paleoenvironment Laboratory (EPOC)\Bordeaux\France; Functional Ecology and Environment Laboratory (EcoLab)\Toulouse\France,-,Adverse effects; Database; Ecotoxicological risk; Pharmaceuticals; Predicted environmental concentration; Predicted no effect concentration

Adsorption based techniques have attracted much research attention for their potential as low-cost and effective methods to reduce the radioactive waste from solution. In this work, we have investigated the adsorption behavior of uranyl species [with the general form UO2(L1)x(L2)y(L3)z, where L1, L2and L3stand for ligands H2O, OH and CO3, respectively] on hydroxylated vanadium carbide V2C(OH)2MXene nanosheets using density functional theory based simulation methods We find that all studied uranyl species can stably bond to hydroxylated MXene with binding energies ranging from −3.3 to −4.6 eV, suggesting that MXenes could be effective adsorbers for uranyl ions. The strong adsorption is achieved by forming two U–O bonds with the hydroxylated Mxene. In addition, the axial oxygen atoms from the uranyl ions form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxylated V2C, further strengthening the adsorption. We have also investigated the effects of F termination on the uranyl adsorption properties of V2C nanosheets. U–F bonds are in general weaker than U–O bonds on the adsorption site, suggesting that F terminated Mexne is less favorable for uranyl adsorption applications.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Yu-Juan; Zhou Zhang-Jian; Lan Jian-Hui; Ge Chang-Chun; Chai Zhi-Fang; Zhang Peihong; Shi Wei-Qun,School of Materials Science and Engineering\University of Science and Technology Beijing\China; Laboratory of Nuclear Energy Chemistry and Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety\Institute of High Energy Physics\China; Department of Physics\University at Buffalo\United States,-,Adsorption mechanism; First principle simulations; Nuclear waste remediation; Uranyl ion; Vanadium carbide mxene
237.html,Fabrication of Bi modified Bi2S3pillared g-C3N4photocatalyst and its efficient photocatalytic reduction and oxidation performances,"A novel efficient Bi modified Bi2S3pillared g-C3N4(BBC) plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst has been successfully developed in a mixed solvothermal environment. The photocatalytic abilities of the as-prepared samples are examined by the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and oxidation of tetracycline (TC). And the chemical composition, structure, morphology and photo-absorption properties of the photocatalysts have been investigated by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, HRTEM and DRS methods, respectively. It is found that the addition of triethanolamine (TEA) results in the formation of the pillared-g-C3N4(PG) nanostructure. The agglomeration of g-C3N4nanosheets moiety and Bi2S3nanorods moiety can be both hindered effectively by the special PG structure. And the photocatalytic results indicate that BBC exhibits the best photoreduction and photooxidation performances among all the samples, and meanwhile possesses superior photo-stability during the recycling runs. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BBC could be ascribed to the furtherance of charge separation, localized surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of metallic Bi and the excellent reaction interface. Finally, a tentative mechanism of BBC for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and oxidation of TC is discussed in detail.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chen Dongdong; Fang Jianzhang; Lu Shaoyou; Zhou GuangYing; Feng Weihua; Yang Fan; Chen Yi; Fang ZhanQiang,China School of Chemistry and Environment\South China Normal University\China; China Guangdong Technology Research Center for Ecological Management and Remediation of Urban Water System\Guangzhou\China; Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention\Shenzhen\China,-,Excellent reaction interface; Photocatalysis; Pillared; SPR effect; Triethanolamine (TEA)
238.html,Changes in grassland management and plant diversity in a marginal region of the Carpathian Mts. in 1999–2015,"The political change from socialism to democracy in countries of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 20th century induced broad changes in agriculture mostly due to land ownership changes and strong reduction of subsidies to agriculture. This resulted in agricultural decline, including grassland abandonment, which influenced grassland biodiversity and conservation. Between 1999 and 2015 we studied the grasslands in the area depopulated in the early 1980's in the Poloniny National Park (NE Slovakia, Carpathian Mts.). The aim of the study was to examine influence of environmental factors and grassland management driven by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to plant community structure and taxonomical diversity. We identified altitude and soil properties as the main environmental factors: altitude determines climate gradient and probably also management intensity gradient and soil properties express soil fertility via A-horizon depth. We identified remarkable increase of proportion of managed grasslands from only 8% in 1999 to 40% in 2012–2015; other 7% of sampled grasslands were recently restored and prepared for future management. The average species richness in grasslands managed in 2012–2015 increased from 47.5 species per record in 1999 to 54.2 species in 2012–2015, the increase was found statistically significant. In 2012–2015, we observed statistically significant difference in the average species richness between managed (54.2) and abandoned grasslands (46.3). The agricultural subsidies of the CAP drive the grassland management in the study area. Therefore, we conclude that CAP enabled grassland biodiversity maintenance in significant part of the Poloniny National Park following start of its application in 2004 and above provided figures can be considered as indicators of the CAP effectiveness in our study area. However, the conservation of mountain meadows remains a challenge because of their poor accessibility. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Halada Ľuboš; David Stanislav; Hreško Juraj; Klimantová Alexandra; Bača Andrej; Rusňák Tomáš; Buraľ Miroslav; Vadel Ľuboš,Institute of Landscape Ecology SAS\branch Nitra\Slovakia; Poloniny National Park Administration\ul.

Special attention was focused on the effect of surface defect on the oil detachment. Our simulation results suggest that compared with perfect Al2O3surface, defective substrate surface provides much more sites for the adsorption of oil molecules, thus it has higher oil adsorption energy. However, higher oil-solid adsorption energy does not mean that oil contaminants are much more difficult to be detached. It is found that surface defect could induce the spontaneous imbibition of water molecules, effectively promoting the detachment of oil molecules. Thus, compared with perfect alumina surface, the detachment of oil molecules from defective alumina surface tends to be much easier. Moreover, surface defect could lead to the oil residues inside surface defect. In water solution, the entire detachment process of oil molecules on defective surface consists of following stages, including the early detachment of oil molecules inside surface defect induced by capillary-driven spontaneous imbibition of water molecules, the following conformational change of oil molecules on topmost surface and the final migration of detached oil molecules from solid surface. These findings may help to sufficiently enrich the removal mechanism of oil molecules adhered onto defective solid surface.                          © 2017",-,Center for Precision Engineering\Harbin Institute of Technology\China,-,Detachment; Molecular dynamics simulation; Oil molecules; Surface defect; Water channel

The results of the works of the Polish Cliff Mission at Deir el-Bahari 1999-2014,"Since 1999, the Polish Cliff Mission has been excavating and cleaning the rocky slopes overhanging the area of the temples of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III at Deir el-Bahari. The site, called by us Gebel Ragab, has so far been considered as a kind of cliff ledge, because a large number of stones lying there was suggestive of the presence of a natural horizontal rocky structure supporting these. In fact, it became evident that the whole site was an abruptly falling slope ending at a precipice. It was a masterpiece of ancient Egyptian engineering that an artificial 'mound', consisting among others of huge boulders, was constructed on such an oblique surface. This ancient work was intentional, and a hypothesis that under this artificial accumulation of stones and debris a tomb may have been expected, seemed justified. No tomb, however, has been discovered on this slope, but two important observations have been made: In two spots tomb shafts were begun (never finished), and all the numerous tectonic fissures, cutting the slope across, were intentionally covered by a kind of mortar. This has revived a hypothesis that the tomb of Amenhotep I may be situated at a lower level, several tens of meters below the Gebel Ragab area, on the slope falling from the foot of the vertical cliffs towards the ruins of the temple of Thutmosis III. In such a case Gebel Ragab could be identified with the 'high place' mentioned in the Abbott Papyrus. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

It is found that Au dimer prefers upright adsorption on MgO(100), CaO(100), BaO(100) surfaces and parallel adsorption on TiO2(110) and YSZ(111) surfaces. According to the analysis of the metal-metal cohesive energy (EAu-Au) and the metal-substrate adhesion energy (EAu-Support), we find that Au adatoms prefer 2D cluster on BaO(100) and TiO2(110) surfaces and 3D cluster on MgO(100), CaO(100) and YSZ(111) surfaces. We also find a linear relationship between EAu-Support/EAu-Auand Eb(binding energy of metal atom on the substrate). Furthermore, an interesting correlation between association energies and the amount of transferred charge is found. The findings may help to gain further insight into the structure-property correlation and provide valuable information on crucial parameters in catalyst design.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dong Shan; Zhang Yanxing; Zhang Xilin; Mao Jianjun; Yang Zongxian,College of Physics and Materials Science\Henan Normal University\China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Nano Functional Materials and Applications\Henan Province\China,-,Au dimer; First-principles study; Metal-oxide surfaces; Surface adsorption

The analysis of a lead-doped oxide film prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB) demonstrated that both Cr-rich and Ni-rich oxides were alternatively distributed within the outer layer, whereas the inner layer was porous and poorly protected, causing severe corrosion of the alloy and a thicker film was formed.

242.html,Coating carbon nanotubes with humic acid using an eco-friendly mechanochemical method: Application for Cu(II) ions removal from water and aquatic ecotoxicity,"In this work, industrial grade multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were coated with humic acid (HA) for the first time by means of a milling process, which can be considered an eco-friendly mechanochemical method to prepare materials and composites. The HA-MWCNT hybrid material was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopies (SEM and STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), termogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Raman spectroscopy. STEM and AFM images demonstrated that the MWCNTs were efficiently coated by the humic acid, thus leading to an increase of 20% in the oxygen content at the nanotube surface as observed by the XPS data. After the milling process, the carbon nanotubes were shortened as unveiled by SEM images and the values of ID/IG intensity ratio increased due to shortening of the nanotubes and increasing in the number defects at the graphitic structure of carbon nanotubes walls. The analysis of TGA data showed that the quantity of the organic matter of HA on the nanotube surface was 25%. The HA coating was responsible to favor the dispersion of MWCNTs in ultrapure water (i.e. − 42 mV, zeta-potential value) and to improve their capacity for copper removal. HA-MWCNTs hybrid material adsorbed 2.5 times more Cu(II) ions than oxidized MWCNTs with HNO3, thus evidencing that it is a very efficient adsorbent material for removing copper ions from reconstituted water. The HA-MWCNTs hybrid material did not show acute ecotoxicity to the tested aquatic model organisms (Hydra attenuata, Daphnia magna, and Danio rerio embryos) up to the highest concentration evaluated (10 mg L− 1). The results allowed concluding that the mechanochemical method is effective to coat carbon nanotubes with humic acid, thus generating a functional hybrid material with low aquatic toxicity and great potential to be applied in environmental nanotechnologies such as the removal of heavy metal ions from water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Côa Francine; Strauss Mathias; Clemente Zaira; Rodrigues Neto Laís L.; Lopes Josias R.; Alencar Rafael S.; Souza Filho Antônio G.; Alves Oswaldo L.; Castro Vera Lúcia S.S.; Barbieri Edison; Martinez Diego Stéfani T.,Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory (LNNano)\Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM)\Brazil; Instituto de Pesca – APTA-SAA/SP\Cananéia\Brazil; Laboratory of Ecotoxicology and Biosafety\Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa Environment)\Brazil; School of Technology\University of Campinas (Unicamp)\Brazil,-,Ball milling; Functionalization; Mechanochemistry; Nanoecotoxicology

Therefore, increasing the active S atoms quantity will be a feasible approach to enhance hydrogen evolution. Herein we developed a porous TiO2derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as scaffold to restrict the growth and inhibit the aggregation of MoS2nanosheets. As a result, the thickness of the prepared MoS2nanosheets was less than 3 nm (1–4 layers), with more edges and active S atoms being exposed. This few-layer MoS2-porous TiO2exhibits a H2evolution rate of 897.5 μmol h−1g−1, which is nearly twice as much as free-stand MoS2nanosheets and twenty times more than physical mixture of MoS2with porous TiO2. The high performance is attributed to that more active edge sites in few-layer MoS2-porous TiO2are exposed than pure MoS2.This work provides a new method to construct MOFs derived porous structures for controlling MoS2to expose active sites for HER.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ye Fei; Li Houfen; Yu Hongtao; Chen Shuo; Quan Xie,Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (Ministry of Education\China)\China; College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Taiyuan University of Technology\China,-,Active edge sites; Confined growth; H2evolution; MoS2nanosheets; Porous TiO2

The morphological, microstructure and optical properties of the as-prepared LC/ZnO hybrid composite was characterized with scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and UV–vis. The resulting LC/ZnO hybrid is composed of highly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles embedded on a lignin-based carbon nanosheet, showing excellent photogenerated electrons and holes separation and migration efficiency. The photocatalytic activity of LC/ZnO was much higher than the pure ZnO. The LC/ZnO hybrid composite showed different photocatalytic mechanism for degradation of negative methyl orange (MO) and positive Rhodamine B (RhB). It showed that h+was the main photocatalytic active group during the degradation of MO, ·O2−and ·OH were the photocatalytic active groups during degradation of RhB. This reported photocatalyst with selective degradation of positive and negative organic dyes may have a great application prospect for photoelectric conversion and catalytic materials.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirm the intercalation of PAS into the galleries of LDH. The controlled release behavior triggered by temperature for the PAS-LDH composites has been investigated, and the results show that the release rate of all PAS-LDH composites increases as the increase of temperature. However, the MgAl-PAS-LDH composites (Mg2Al-PAS-LDH and Mg3Al-PAS-LDH) exhibit the increased release rate of 0.21 ppm/°C from 15 to 30 °C in 3.5% NaCl solution, more than three times of the ZnAl-PAS-LDH composites (0.06 ppm/°C), owing to the confined microenvironment influenced by metal types in LDH layers. In addition, a possible diffusion-controlled process with surface diffusion, bulk diffusion and heterogeneous flat surface diffusion has been revealed via fitting four kinetic equations. Moreover, to verify the practical application of the PAS-LDH composites, a model coating denoted as Mg2Al-PAS-LDH coating was fabricated. The release result displays that the release rate increases or decreases as temperature altered at 15 and 25 °C alternately, indicating its self-adaptive controlled release behavior with temperature. Moreover, the superior resistance to the settlement of Ulva spores at 15 and 25 °C was observed for the Mg2Al-PAS-LDH coating, as a result of the controllable release of antifoulant. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method for the fabrication of antifouling composites with self-adaptive controlled release behavior in response to temperature, which can be used to prolong the lifetime of antifouling coatings.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yang Miaosen; Gu Lianghua; Yang Bin; Wang Li; Sun Zhiyong; Zheng Jiyong; Zhang Jinwei; Hou Jian; Lin Cunguo,School of Chemical Engineering\Northeast Electric Power University\China; State Key Laboratory for Marine Corrosion and Protection\Luoyang Ship Material Research Institute\China; Engineering Technology Research Institute\BHDC\China,-,Antifoulant; Antifouling property; Intercalation; Layered double hydroxide; Self-adaptive controlled release

Using flow-through intact sediment core incubations, net sediment N2fluxes before and after a nitrate addition from five wet ponds spanning a range of ages (3.25–10 years old) were quantified through membrane inlet mass spectrometry during early summer. Multiple locations within a single wet pond (6.16 years old) were also sampled during ambient conditions in late summer to determine the combined effects of depth, vegetation, and flow path position on net N2fluxes at the sediment-water interface. All pond sediments had considerable rates of net nitrogen fixation during ambient conditions, and net N2fluxes during nitrate-enriched conditions were significantly correlated with pond age. Following a nitrate addition to simulate storm conditions, younger pond sediments shifted towards net denitrification, but older ponds exhibited even higher rates of net nitrogen fixation. The pond forebay had significantly higher rates of net nitrogen fixation compared to the main basin, and rates throughout the pond were an order of magnitude higher than the early summer experiment. These results identify less than optimal nitrogen processing in this common SCM, however, data presented here suggest that water column mixing and pond sediment excavation could improve the capacity of wet ponds to enhance water quality by permanently removing nitrogen. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,UNC Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences\Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology\United States,-,Coastal stormwater; Denitrification; Nitrogen fixation; Stratification; Water quality; Wet pond
247.html,Association between chronic exposure to different water iodine and thyroid cancer: A retrospective study from 1995 to 2014,"The controversy that iodine intake may increase the risk of thyroid cancer has heightened over the past twenty years. In this retrospective study, we mainly analyzed the association between water iodine and thyroid cancer and discussed the possible cause of the increase in thyroid cancer. This study was supported by three hospitals in areas with different water iodine concentration. 5574 patients with thyroid disease were recruited, of which 1429 patients had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. These samples collectively were used to analyze the relationship of incidence and prevalence associated with water iodine. In addition, the ratio of maximum tumor diameter was analyzed. By analyzing the proportion of patients with thyroid cancer in thyroid diseases, we found a decrease in the proportion of thyroid cancer with increasing water iodine (P < 0.0001). In addition, there was no significant correlation between the median water iodine and the prevalence of thyroid cancer, including papillary thyroid cancer (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, the 5 years' cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer increased with years (P < 0.01). Comparing Cao county and Shan county, which are areas with high water iodine, to adequate iodine area such as in Mudan district, an increasing incidence is observed in 2010–2014 in Mudan district. Again, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of thyroid cancer with tumor size < 1 cm (P < 0.01). Therefore, we concluded that cause(s) of increase in thyroid cancer may be ascribed to the sensitive diagnostic techniques and the improvement of living condition, but not water iodine. © 2017",Lv Chunpeng; Yang Yanmei; Jiang Lixin; Gao Lin; Rong Shengzhong; Darko Gottfried M.; Jiang Wen; Gao Yanhui; Sun Dianjun,Center for Endemic Disease Control\Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\China; Shandong Institute of Prevention and Control for Endemic Disease\Jinan\China; Key Lab of Etiology and Epidemiology\Education Bureau of Heilongjiang Province & Ministry of Health (23618504)\China,-,Incidence; Retrospective study; Sensitive diagnosis; Thyroid cancer; Water iodine

It is studied through the dynamic change of the droplet shape during the evaporation process. An aluminium nitride SAW device, operating at 125.7 MHz, is utilized to investigate the deformation of the droplet shape (contact angle and contact radius) caused by shrinking. The large cavity placed on the propagation path distorts the in-band SAW response one time at the centre frequency. The fractional coefficient of the SAW insertion loss, before and after dropping the liquid on the propagation path, is continuously recorded. The change in the fractional coefficient shows that the radiated acoustic kinetic energy depends on the contact area between the sessile micro-size droplet and the SAW device more than the contact angle of the droplet. Three droplet volumes have been considered, namely 0.05, 0.1 and 0.13 μl, and the electrical results show a better agreement with the theoretical data than the optical image data. The average duration of the fractional coefficient change for these cases is 420, 573 and 760 s, respectively. The effect of the hydrophobicity versus hydrophilicity of the contact surface on the duration of the fractional coefficient change is studied by coating the SAW with a silicon oxide or hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) thin layer. For the same 0.05 μl sessile droplet on the hydrophobic surface, this duration is on average 110 s longer than that on the hydrophilic surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bui ThuHang; Nguyen Van; Vollebregt Sten; Morana Bruno; van Zeijl Henk; Chu Duc Trinh; Sarro Pasqualina M.,Microelectronics\Delft University of Technology\Netherlands; Electronics and Telecommunications\University of Engineering and Technology\Viet Nam; Graduate School of Information Science\Tohoku University\Japan,-,Acoustics; Microfluidics; Piezoelectric; SAW devices

In this work, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the responses of vanadium nitride (VN) films with different kinds of TB atoms (V or N) subjected to uniaxial tensile/compressive deformations, to investigate their effects and the tensile-compressive asymmetry. In compressive deformation, the migration of TBs with V atoms to that with N atoms contributes to softening, while the pile-up of dislocations at TBs contributes to strengthening. During tension, fractures occur at the TBs without distinct nucleation of dislocations, the nature of the brittle fracture, which does not result in any improvement of fracture toughness and critical stress. Different frictional effects, cutoff radii, asymmetrical tensile and compressive nature of the interatomic potential and different deformation mechanisms are responsible for the tension-compression asymmetry in VN. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fu Tao; Peng Xianghe; Huang Cheng; Zhao Yinbo; Weng Shayuan; Chen Xiang; Hu Ning,Chongqing University\College of Aerospace Engineering\China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control\Chongqing University\China; Advanced Manufacturing Engineering\Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications\China,-,Molecular dynamics simulation; Nanotwin; Tension-compression asymmetry; Twin boundary migration; Vanadium nitride

The mgt.PHEMA@PEG microspheres contained ∼10 μmol COOH per g. Biocompatibility of the particles was evaluated by their treatment with human embryonic kidney cells of the HEK293 line. The microspheres did not interfere with the growth of these cells, suggesting that the particles can be considered non-toxic. A second goal of this study was to address on the interaction of the developed microspheres with macrophages that commonly eliminate foreign microbodies appearing in organisms. Murine J774.2 macrophages (J774.2) were cultured in the presence of the neat and PEGylated microspheres for 2 h. Mgt.PHEMA@PEG5,000microspheres significantly adhered to the surface of J774.2 macrophages but were minimally engulfed. Due to these properties, the mgt.PHEMA@PEG microspheres might be useful for application in drug delivery systems and monitoring of the efficiency of phagocytosis.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Horák Daniel; Hlidková Helena; Klyuchivska Olga; Grytsyna Iryna; Stoika Rostyslav,Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\AS CR\Czech Republic; Institute of Cell Biology\NAS of Ukraine\Ukraine,-,Magnetic; Microspheres; Murine macrophages; Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); Poly(ethylene glycol)

An essential property of organic films is the surface glass transition temperature (surface-Tg) and many methods for characterizing surface-Tg have been studied. We propose a novel method for characterizing surface-Tg based on metal-vapor atom deposition and desorption. We monitored metal-vapor deposition and desorption on organic surfaces using double quartz crystal microbalances. Mg vapor is not deposited on organic surfaces with a low bulk-Tg such as a colorless photochromic diarylethene (DAE) film. This deposition phenomenon is caused by Mg-atom desorption from the surface based on active surface molecular motion. However, Mg deposition began after a certain time of continuous evaporation (deposition-threshold time). The threshold time elongated with increased substrate temperature and elongated dramatically at a substrate temperature several degrees below the bulk-Tg for DAE. The surface molecular motion becomes active and the metal-atom desorption accelerates as the temperature neared the surface-Tg. Thus a temperature with a dramatic elongation of the threshold time indicates the surface-Tg. This method can be applied to a variety of organic films. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tsujioka Tsuyoshi; Okuda Masaki,Department of Arts and Sciences\Osaka Kyoiku University\Japan,-,Desorption; Metal-vapor deposition; Organic surface; Quartz crystal microbalance; Surface glass-transition temperature
252.html,"Effects of local land-use on riparian vegetation, water quality, and the functional organization of macroinvertebrate assemblages","Land-use change is a principal factor affecting riparian vegetation and river biodiversity. In Chile, land-use change has drastically intensified over the last decade, with native forests converted to exotic forest plantations and agricultural land. However, the effects thereof on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Closing this knowledge gap first requires understanding how human perturbations affect riparian and stream biota. Identified biological indicators could then be applied to determine the health of fluvial ecosystems. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of land-use change on the health of riparian and aquatic ecosystems by assessing riparian vegetation, water quality, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, and functional feeding groups. Twenty-one sites in catchment areas with different land-uses (i.e. pristine forests, native forests, exotic forest plantations, and agricultural land) were selected and sampled during the 2010 to 2012 dry seasons. Riparian vegetation quality was highest in pristine forests. Per the modified Macroinvertebrate Family Biotic Index for Chilean species, the best conditions existed in native forests and the worst in agricultural catchments. Water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly varied across land-use areas, with forest plantations and agricultural land having high nutrient concentrations, conductivity, suspended solids, and apparent color. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was lowest for agricultural and exotic forest plantation catchments, with notable non-insect representation. Collector-gatherers were the most abundant functional feeding group, suggesting importance independent of land-use. Land-use areas showed no significant differences in functional feeding groups. In conclusion, anthropogenic land-use changes were detectable through riparian quality, water quality, and macroinvertebrate assemblages, but not through functional feeding groups. These data, particularly the riparian vegetation and macroinvertebrate assemblage parameters, could be applied towards the conservation and management of riparian ecosystems through land-use change studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fierro Pablo; Bertrán Carlos; Tapia Jaime; Hauenstein Enrique; Peña-Cortés Fernando; Vergara Carolina; Cerna Cindy; Vargas-Chacoff Luis,Institute of Marine Science and Limnology\Universidad Austral de Chile\Chile; Center of Environmental Sciences EULA-CHILE\Universidad de Concepción\Chile; Institute of Chemistry and Natural Resources\Universidad de Talca\Chile; Territorial Planning Laboratory\Universidad Católica de Temuco\Chile,-,Agriculture; Anthropogenic disturbance; Bioindicators; Exotic forest plantations; Riparian forests

China, as one of the largest shipping countries, has long been in great need of in-depth analysis of ship emissions. This study for the first time developed a comprehensive national-scale ship emission inventory with 0.005° × 0.005° resolution in China for 2014, using the bottom-up method based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data of the full year of 2014. The emission estimation involved 166,546 unique vessels observed from over 15 billion AIS reports, covering OGVs (ocean-going vessels), CVs (coastal vessels) and RVs (river vessels). Results show that the total estimated ship emissions for China in 2014 were 1.1937 × 106t (SO2), 2.2084 × 106t (NOX), 1.807 × 105t (PM10), 1.665 × 105t (PM2.5), 1.116 × 105t (HC), 2.419 × 105t (CO), and 7.843 × 107t (CO2, excluding RVs), respectively. OGVs were the main emission contributors, with proportions of 47%–74% of the emission totals for different species. Vessel type with the most emissions was container (~ 43.6%), followed by bulk carrier (~ 17.5%), oil tanker (~ 5.7%) and fishing ship (~ 4.9%). Monthly variations showed that emissions from transport vessels had a low point in February, while fishing ship presented two emission peaks in May and September. In terms of port clusters, ship emissions in BSA (Bohai Sea Area), YRD (Yangtze River Delta) and PRD (Pearl River Delta) accounted for ~ 13%, ~ 28% and ~ 17%, respectively, of the total emissions in China. On the contrast, the average emission intensities in PRD were the highest, followed by the YRD and BSA regions. The establishment of this high-spatiotemporal-resolution ship emission inventory fills the gap of national-scale ship emission inventory of China, and the corresponding ship emission characteristics are expected to provide certain reference significance for the management and control of the ship emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chen Dongsheng; Wang Xiaotong; Li Yue; Lang Jianlei; Zhou Ying; Guo Xiurui; Zhao Yuehua,Key Laboratory of Beijing on Regional Air Pollution Control\Beijing University of Technology\China; Transport Planning and Research Institute\Ministry of Transport\China,-,Automatic identification system; China; Ship emissions; “Bottom up” method
254.html,Application of thermography for monitoring stomatal conductance of Coffea arabica under different shading systems,"Stomatal regulation is a key process in the physiology of Coffea arabica (C. arabica). Intrinsically linked to photosynthesis and water relations, it provides insights into the plant's adaptive capacity, survival and growth. The ability to rapidly quantify this parameter for C. arabica under different agroecological systems would be an indispensable tool. Using a Flir E6 MIR Camera, an index that is equivalent to stomatal conductance (Ig) was compared with stomatal conductance measurements (gs) in a mature coffee plantation. In order to account for varying meteorological conditions between days, the methods were also compared under stable meteorological conditions in a laboratory and Igwas also converted to absolute stomatal conductance values (g1). In contrast to typical plant-thermography methods which measure indices once per day over an extended time period, we used high resolution hourly measurements over daily time series with 9 sun and 9 shade replicates. Eight daily time series showed a strong correlation between methods, while the remaining 10 were not significant. Including several other meteorological parameters in the calculation of g1did not contribute to any stronger correlation between methods. Total pooled data (combined daily series) resulted in a correlation of ρ = 0.66 (P ≤ 2.2e − 16), indicating that our approach is particularly useful for situations where absolute values of stomatal conductance are not required, such as for comparative purposes, screening or trend analysis. We use the findings to advance the protocol for a more accurate methodology which may assist in quantifying advantageous microenvironment designs for coffee, considering the current and future climates of coffee growing regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,School of Geography\Archaeology and Environmental Studies\South Africa; Ghent University\Faculty of Bioscience Engineering\Belgium; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)\P.O.

255.html,New insights into canted spiro carbon interstitial in graphite,"The self-interstitial carbon is the key to radiation damage in graphite moderator nuclear reactor, so an understanding of its behavior is essential for plant safety and maximized reactor lifetime. The density functional theory is applied on four different graphite unit cells, starting from of 64 carbon atoms up to 256 carbon atoms, using AIMPRO code to obtain the energetic, athermal and mechanical properties of carbon interstitial in graphite. This study presents first principles calculations of the energy of formation that prove its high barrier to athermal diffusion (1.1 eV) and the consequent large critical shear stress (39 eV–50 eV) necessary to shear graphite planes in its presence. Also, for the first time, the gamma surface of graphite in two dimensions is calculated and found to yield the critical shear stress for perfect graphite. Finally, in contrast to the extensive literature describing the interstitial of carbon in graphite as spiro interstitial, in this work the ground state of interstitial carbon is found to be canted spiro interstitial. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Physics Department\Faculty of Education\Egypt,-,DFT; Gamma surface of graphite; Interstitial carbon; Migration of interstitial
256.html,DFT study of hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition on Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters,"Recently, it has been reported that the hydrogen production rate of formic acid decomposition can be significantly increased using Pd-Au binary alloy nano-catalysts [Wang et al. J. Mater. Chem. A 1 (2013) 12721–12725]. To explain the reaction mechanism of this alloy catalysis method, formic acid decomposition reactions on pure Pd and Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters are studied via density functional theory simulations. The simulation results indicate that the addition of inert element Au would not influence formic acid decomposition on Pd surface sites of Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters. On the other hand, the existence of Au surface sites brings relative weak hydrogen atom adsorption. On Pd-Au alloy nanoclusters, the dissociated hydrogen atoms from formic acid are easier to combine as hydrogen molecules than that on pure Pd clusters. Via the synergetic effect between Pd and Au, both formic acid decomposition and hydrogen production are events with large probability, which eventually results in high hydrogen production rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,State Key Laboratory of Metastable Materials Science and Technology\Yanshan University\China,-,Catalysis; DFT simulations; Formic acid decomposition; Hydrogen production; Pd-Au alloy

The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), and UV–vis reflectance spectroscopy. The synergistic effect of EG and HF plays a vital role in the formation of synthesized TiO2with Ti3+self-doping, internal-pores and highly exposed {001} facets. As-synthesized TiO2exhibit much higher activity than commercial P25 on photocatalytic degradation of phenol and the outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ti3+doping, internal-pores, and facets heterojunction.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sui Yulei; Liu Qingxia; Jiang Tao; Guo Yufeng,School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering\Central South University\China; Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering\University of Alberta\Canada,-,facets heterojunction; internal-pores; photocatalytic degradation; Ti3+doping; TiO2single crystals

In this study, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and China's Land Use/Cover Datasets (CLUDs) were used to examine the temporal trends of SUHIs in 31 major Chinese cities during 2001–2015 using three indicators: SUHI intensity (SUHII), area of the SUHI (AreaSUHI) and percentage of area with increasing SUHII (PAISUHII). Correlation analyses between SUHII and background (rural) LST (extracted from MODIS LST), vegetation coverage (reflected by MODIS EVI data) and anthropogenic heat release (reflected by nighttime light data) were performed from temporal rather than spatial perspectives. Our findings showed that the SUHII and AreaSUHIin urbanized areas increased significantly in most cities in summer days, whereas they increased significantly in approximately half and more than half of the cities in summer and winter nights, respectively. In summer days, summer nights and winter nights, the PAISUHII was approximately 80% and over 50% in union areas and the 20 km buffer, respectively. Correlation analyses indicated that the SUHII in stable urban areas was negatively correlated with the background LST in summer and winter days for most cities, especially in northern China. A reduction in vegetation contributed to the increasing SUHII in urbanized areas in summer days and nights. The increasing anthropogenic heat release was an important factor for increases in the SUHII in urbanized areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yao Rui; Wang Lunche; Huang Xin; Niu Zigeng; Liu Fongfu; Wang Qing,Laboratory of Critical Zone Evolution\School of Earth Sciences\China; School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering\Wuhan University\China; State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying\Mapping and Remote Sensing\China,-,China; Surface urban heat island; Temporal trend; Urbanization
259.html,Fabrication of hierarchical porous ZnO-Al2O3microspheres with enhanced adsorption performance,"Hierarchical porous ZnO–Al2O3microspheres were fabricated through a simple hydrothermal route. The as-prepared hierarchical porous ZnO–Al2O3composites were utilized as adsorbents to remove organic dye Congo red (CR) from water. The ZnO–Al2O3composites had morphology of microspheres with diameters in the range of 12–16 μm, which were assembled by nanosheets with thicknesses of approximately 60 nm. The adsorption kinetics of CR onto the ZnO–Al2O3composites was properly fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption data were perfectly described by the Langmuir isotherm and had a maximum adsorption capacity that reached 397 mg/g, which was significantly higher than the value of the pure alumina (Al2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) samples. The superior CR removal efficiency of the ZnO–Al2O3composites was attributed to its well-developed hierarchical porous structures and larger specific surface area (201 m2/g), which were conducive to the diffusion and adsorption of CR molecules. Moreover, the regeneration study reveals that the ZnO–Al2O3composites have suitable stability and reusability. The results also indicate that the as-prepared sample can act as a highly effective adsorbent in anionic dye removal from wastewater.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lei Chunsheng; Pi Meng; Xu Difa; Jiang Chuanjia; Cheng Bei,State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing\Wuhan University of Technology\China; College of Environmental & Safety Engineering\Changzhou University\China; Hunan Key Laboratory of Applied Environmental Photocatalysis\Changsha University\China,-,Adsorption; Alumina; Anionic dye; Hierarchical porous structure; Zinc oxide

It is found that all the molecules are physisorbed on the InSe monolayer surface and act as electron acceptors for the InSe, except NH3which is found to be an electron donor. Furthermore, for most of the molecules studied, the adsorption cannot induce obvious changes in the band structures near the Fermi level compared with those of the pristine InSe monolayer. However, it is noted that the adsorbed InSe monolayers have new in-gap states induced by the open-shell molecules (NO2, NO, and O2), which may trigger some new effects on the optical properties of the materials. Our theoretical findings suggest that two-dimensional InSe nanomaterials hold great promise for fabricating gas sensors based on a physisorption-based charge transfer mechanism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ma Dongwei; Ju Weiwei; Tang Yanan; Chen Yue,School of Physics\Anyang Normal University\China; Department of Mechanical Engineering\The University of Hong Kong\Hong Kong; College of Physics and Engineering\Henan University of Science and Technology\China; College of Physics and Electronic Engineering\Zhengzhou Normal University\China,-,Charge transfer; First-principles calculation; Gas sensing; InSe monolayer; Molecular adsorption
262.html,Prediction of fish catch in the Danube River based on long-term variability in environmental parameters and catch statistics,"The effects of physical factors on fish catch in the Serbian part of the Danube River were studied for period of six decades. The data on total catch for the Danube River from river kilometre 845 to river kilometre 1433 were collected from Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, while water level and water temperature data were collected from 16 water gauge stations along the investigated part of the Danube River for the period 1948–2009. Cross-correlation functions have been used to analyse the functional connection between Danube water level, water temperature and fish catch while ARMA model which combines cyclic (deterministic) and random (stochastic) components of the analysed sequences was used for the forecasts. The cross-correlation function showed negative correlation between water level and temperature as well as between water temperature and catch and positive correlation between water level and catch. The Danube water level and catch were coherent at the periods of 2.06, 4.13, 6.2, 10.33, 20.66 years, while the cross correlation function between these time series did not show phase lag. The results of reconstruction and forecast of water level, temperature, and catch of fish in the Danube River, obtained by summing the cyclic and stochastic components, was used for the forecast till 2029. In 2016, seven years after, the initial forecasts were made, validity of the model was checked by obtaining data for water temperature, water level and fish catch in the Danube River for the period 2010–2015. Model gave the best prediction for water temperature; average standard error was 1.6 times higher for predicted value than for model value while for fish catch and water level they were 1.96 and 4.97, respectively. Methods used in this work could be powerful tool for prediction of fish catch and serve as the basis for better fisheries management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Smederevac-Lalić Marija M.; Kalauzi Aleksandar J.; Regner Slobodan B.; Lenhardt Mirjana B.; Naunovic Zorana Z.; Hegediš Aleksandar E.,University of Belgrade\Institute for Multidisciplinary Research\Serbia; University of Belgrade\Institute for Biological Research\Serbia; University of Belgrade\Faculty of Civil Engineering\Serbia,-,Fishery; Large river; Solar cycle; Water level; Water temperature
263.html,"Urban environments alter parasite fauna, weight and reproductive activity in the quenda (Isoodon obesulus)","Some wildlife species are capable of surviving in urbanised environments. However, the implications of urbanisation on wildlife health, and public health regarding zoonoses, are often unknown. Quenda (syn. southern brown bandicoots, Isoodon obesulus) survive in many areas of Perth, Australia, despite urbanisation. This study investigated differences in gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto-parasitic infections, morphometrics and reproductive status between bushland and urban dwelling quenda. 287 quenda in the greater Perth region were captured and sampled for faeces (to detect gastrointestinal parasites), blood (to detect Toxoplasma gondii antibodies), ectoparasites, and morphometrics. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic and linear regression. Most parasitic infections identified in quenda were of native parasite taxa that are either not known to, or considered highly unlikely to, infect humans or domestic animals. However, stickfast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) were present at low prevalences and intensities, and Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Amblyomma spp. infections require further investigation to clarify their anthropozoonotic significance. Quenda captured in urbanised environments had differing odds of or intensity of certain parasitic infections, compared to those in bushland – likely attributable to quenda population density, and in some cases the availability of other host species or anthropogenic sources of infection. Urbanised environments were associated with an increase in net weight of adult male quenda by 189.0 g (95% CI 68.6–309.5 g; p = 0.002; adjusted R2= 0.06) and adult female quenda by 140.1 g (95% CI 3.9–276.3 g; p = 0.044; adjusted R2= 0.07), with study findings suggesting a tendency towards obesity in urbanised environments. Adult female quenda in bushland had increased odds of an active pouch (adjusted OR = 4.89, 95% CI 1.7–14.5), suggesting decreased reproductive activity in quenda from urbanised environments. These results highlight the subtle, yet extensive impacts that urbanised environments may have on wildlife ecology, even for those species which apparently adjust well to urbanisation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hillman Alison E.; Lymbery Alan J.; Elliot Aileen D.,School of Veterinary and Life Sciences\Murdoch University\Australia; Alison Hillman-email\90 South St\Australia,-,Disease; Marsupial; Obesity; Reproduction; Wildlife; Zoonosis

Thus, a 3-month-long experiment using two typical paddy soils in China (red soil and black soil) was conducted to assess the effects of hexaconazole (0.6 (T1) and 6 (T10) mg kg− 1soil) on the overall microbial biomass, respiratory activity, bacterial abundance and community structure, and nitrogen transformations. Soil was sampled after 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of incubation. The half-lives of the two doses of hexaconazole varied from 122 to 135 d in the black soil and from 270 to 845 d in the red soil. Both dosages of hexaconazole did not affect NH+4-N content, N2-fixing bacterial populations, total bacterial diversity, and community structure, but transitorily decreased the populations of total bacteria in both soil types. In the black soil, T10 negatively affected microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil basal respiration (RB), but transitorily increased NO−3–N concentration and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria populations, while T1 had almost no effect on most of the indicators. As for red soil, both concentrations of fungicide significantly, but transitorily, inhibited MBC and RB, while only T10 had a relatively long stimulatory effect on NO−3–N concentration and ammonia-oxidizing archaea populations. This study showed that over application of hexaconazole is indeed harmful to soil microorganisms and may reduce soil quality and increase the risk of nitrogen loss in paddy soils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ju Chao; Xu Jun; Wu Xiaohu; Dong Fengshou; Liu Xingang; Tian Chunyan; Zheng Yongquan,State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests\Institute of Plant Protection\China,-,Hexaconazole; Microbial activity; Microbial biomass; Microbial community; Soil nitrogen transformations

Channels of nanometric dimensions were created on surface of the specimens by using a less common atomic force microscopy (AFM) method, namely Dynamic Plowing Lithography (DPL). The changes generated by DPL procedure were monitored through the surface texture and other functional parameters, denoting the surface orientation degree and also bearing and fluid retention properties. The results revealed that in the same nanolithography conditions, the diamine and dianhydride moieties have affected the characteristics of the nanochannels. This was explained based on the aliphatic/aromatic nature of the monomers and the backbone flexibility. The reported data are of great importance in designing custom nanostructures with enhanced anisotropy on surface of polyimide films for liquid crystal orientation or guided cell growth purposes. At the end, to track the effect of the nanolithography process on the tip sharpness, degradation and contamination, the blind tip reconstruction was performed on AFM probe, before and after lithography experiments, using TGT1 test grating AFM image. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Stoica Iuliana; Barzic Andreea Irina; Hulubei Camelia,“Petru Poni” Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\Department of Polymer Materials Physics\Romania; “Petru Poni” Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\Department of Polymer Physical Chemistry\Romania; “Petru Poni” Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry\Department of Polycondensation and Thermostable Polymers\Romania,-,Atomic force microscopy; Dynamic plowing lithography; Nanochannels; Surface morphology; Surface texture analysis
266.html,"Review on characteristics of PAHs in atmosphere, anthropogenic sources and control technologies","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic compounds composed of multiple aromatic rings. PAHs are ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants which are well-recognized as carcinogenic, teratogenic and genotoxic compounds. PAHs are released from incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of materials containing carbon and hydrogen, such as coal, oil, wood and petroleum products. Understanding the characteristics of PAHs in atmosphere, source profiles and technologies available for controlling PAHs emission is essential to reduce the impacts of PAHs. This paper offers an overview on concentration and distribution of atmospheric PAHs, emission factors and distribution of PAHs in different sources, and available control technologies. Characteristics of atmospheric PAHs vary with meteorological conditions and emission sources, while characteristics of PAHs emission depend on burned material and combustion condition. Combination of some technologies may be necessary for effective removal of both low-ring and high-ring PAHs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dat Nguyen-Duy; Chang Moo Been,Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering\National Central University\Taiwan,-,Ambient air; Characteristics; Control technologies; PAHs; Sources
267.html,Self-organization of palladium nanoislands on GaN and AlxGa1−xN/GaN heterostructures,"We report on systematic study on the dewetting process of thin Pd layer and self-organized Pd nano-islands on SiO2, GaN and AlxGa1−xN/GaN heterostructures with various Al content. The influence of factors such as the thickness of metal layer, type of top layer of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, temperature and time of annealing process on the dimensions, shapes and density of Pd islands was analyzed. Comparing the behavior of self-organization of Pd islands on Al0.25Ga0.75N/GaN and SiO2we can conclude that solid-state dewetting process on SiO2occures much faster than on Al0.25Ga0.75N. For substrates with SiO2this process requires less energy and can arise for thicker layer. On the Al0.25Ga0.75N surface the islands take more crystalline shape which is probably due to surface reconstruction of Pd-Ga alloy thin layer on interface. For thin metal layer the coalescence of islands into larger islands similar to Ostwald ripening mechanism was observed. Greater surface roughness of AlxGa1−xN/GaN heterostructures with higher Al content causes an increase of surface density of islands and the reduction of their sizes which improves the roundness. In case of GaN and AlxGa1−xN layers with Al content lower than 20%, the surface degradation caused by annealing process was observed. Probably, this is due to the decomposition of layers with gallium droplet formation on catalytic metal islands.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Stafiniak Andrzej; Szymański Tomasz; Paszkiewicz Regina,Faculty of Microsystem Electronics and Photonics\Wroclaw University of Science and Technology\Poland,-,AlGaN/GaN heterostructures; Pd nanoislands; Solid-state dewetting
268.html,Operando study of Fe3O4anodes by electrochemical atomic force microscopy,"Present study provided visual evidence of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation on Fe3O4anode during charge and discharge using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy. AFM images show that SEI layer formed on Fe3O4electrode from fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)-based electrolyte was more stable and compact than that formed from ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte. In addition, presence of surface cracks on the electrodes indicated poor formation of an intact SEI layer. This observation was more apparent in the EC-based electrolyte. Lack of an intact SEI layer resulted in decomposition of electrolytes which were reflected by presence of large air bubbles and dendrites on the electrode during CV. Although FEC-based electrolyte improved the performance of Fe3O4anodes in lithium ion batteries, its protective effects were far from perfect. To accelerate the application of Fe3O4or other metal oxide anodes in lithium ion batteries, better electrolytes and sophisticated carbon coating techniques are needed.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Shuwei; Zhang Weicong; Chen Yuanning; Dai Zhengwu; Zhao Chongchong; Wang Deyu; Shen Cai,Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology & Engineering\Chinese Academy of Sciences\China; Foundation Department\Zhejiang Wanli University\China; Ningbo Baohong Information Technology Co.\Ltd.\China; Ningbo Micro Energy Technology Co.\Ltd.\China,-,Anode; Atomic force microscopy; Iron oxide; Lithium-ion batteries; Solid electrolyte interphase
269.html,Origin and chemical composition of the amorphous material from the intergrain pores of self-assembled cubic ZnS:Mn nanocrystals,"We have shown in previous investigations that the low temperature collective magnetism observed in mesoporous cubic ZnS:Mn nanocrystalline powders prepared by colloidal synthesis, with nominal doping concentrations above 0.2 at.%, is due to the formation of Mn2+clusters with distributed antiferromagnetic coupling localized in an amorphous phase found between the cubic ZnS:Mn nanocrystals. Here we investigate the composition, origin and thermal annealing behavior of this amorphous phase in such a mesoporous ZnS:Mn sample doped with 5 at.% Mn nominal concentration. Correlated analytical transmission electron microscopy, multifrequency electron paramagnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data show that the amorphous nanomaterial consists of unreacted precursor hydrated zinc and manganese acetates trapped inside the pores and on the surface of the cubic ZnS nanocrystals. The decomposition of the acetates under isochronal annealing up to 270 °C, where the mesoporous structure is still preserved, lead to changes in the nature and strength of the magnetic interactions between the aggregated Mn2+ions. These results strongly suggest the possibility to modulate the magnetic properties of such transition metal ions doped II–VI mesoporous structures by varying the synthesis conditions and/or by post-synthesis thermochemical treatments.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Stefan Mariana; Vlaicu Ioana Dorina; Nistor Leona Cristina; Ghica Daniela; Nistor Sergiu Vasile,National Institute of Materials Physics\Atomistilor 405A Str.\Romania,-,Analytical transmission electron microscopy; Electron paramagnetic resonance; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mesoporous cubic ZnS; Mn2+dopant ions; Secondary phase
27.html,A survey of astronomical tables on Middle Kingdom coffin lids,"Diagonal star tables on 12 Middle Kingdom coffin lids and one monument were described in 1960 in Neugebauer and Parker's Egyptian Astronomical Texts Volume 1. Since then, the number of similar tables on coffins has doubled, with additional examples being excavated and, chiefly, found in museum collections. No additional monumental examples have been found. The McMaster Ancient Egyptian Astronomical Tables Project was conceived with the goal of re-assessing all the coffin-based tables, and collating existing and new information in one place. The work included museum visits and photographic requests, careful collation with previous publications, and the construction of an online resource acting as a data repository. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

270.html,Facile synthesis of hydrangea-like core-shell Pd@Pt/graphene composite as an efficient electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation,"Core-shell palladium@platinum/graphene composite (denoted as Pd@Pt/GNs (PDDA)) was synthesized by successive reduction with formic acid as a reducing agent and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) solution (PDDA) as a structure-directing agent at ambient temperature. The as-synthesized Pd@Pt/GNs (PDDA) was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that hydrangea-like PtPd bimetallic nanoclusters on graphene (GNs) are formed with the aid of morphology control of PDDA. Especially, they are in a typical core-shell structure with Pd as core and Pt as shell, which are uniformly dispersed on the surface of GNs. Electrocatalytic tests show that Pd@Pt/GNs (PDDA) exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation (with the mass activities of 870.8 mA mg−1Pt) in comparison with the commercial Pt/C and alloyed Pd-Pt/GNs (PDDA) catalysts owing to its unique Pd core Pt shell hydrangea-like structure and the synergistic effects between Pd@Pt and GNs.                          © 2017",Xu Shuhong; Li Zhongshui; Lei Fengling; Wang Yanli; Xie Yixin; Lin Shen,College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering\Fujian Normal University\China; Fujian provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials Oriented Chemical Engineering\Fuzhou\China,-,Core-shell structure; Electrocatalyst; Methanol oxidation; Palladium; Platinum

Herein, the method has been developed to prepare nitrogen-doped biomass-derived carbon nanofibers/graphene aerogel (NCGA) as the binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. Ethylenediamine (EDA) is select as nitrogen source for its high nitrogen content and strong interaction with graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) via hydrothermal self-assembly method to form hybrid hydrogel, and finally converts to NCGA by freeze-drying and carbonization. After carbonization the insulated CNFs converted to high conductivity carbon nanofibers. The NCGA electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 289 F g−1at 5 mV s−1and high stability of 90.5% capacitance retention ratio after 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1.

272.html,Green and facile synthesis of fibrous Ag/cotton composites and their catalytic properties for 4-nitrophenol reduction,"Natural cotton, featuring abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, has been utilized as a reductant to synthesize Ag nanoparticles on its surface. Through the facile and environment-friendly reduction process, the fibrous Ag/cotton composite (FAC) was conveniently synthesized. Various characterization techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, SEM, EDS and FT-IR had been utilized to study the material microstructure and surface properties. The resulting FAC exhibited favorable activity on the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol with high reaction rate. Moreover, the fibrous Ag/cotton composites were capable to form a desirable catalytic mat for catalyzing and simultaneous product separation. Reactants passing through the mat could be catalytically transformed to product, which is of great significance for water treatment. Such catalyst (FAC) was thus expected to have the potential as a highly efficient, cost-effective and eco-friendly catalyst for industrial applications. More importantly, this newly developed synthetic methodology could serve as a general tool to design and synthesize other metal/biomass composites catalysts for a wider range of catalytic applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Ziyu; Jia Zhigang; Ni Tao; Li Shengbiao,School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Anhui University of Technology\China,-,4-Nitrophenol; Ag nanoparticles; Cotton; Reduction
273.html,"Effects of exposure to pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and carbamazepine) spiked sediments in the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Chironomidae)","Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and degradation products are continuously introduced into the environment. To date, there is a lack of information about the effects of pharmaceuticals in spiked toxicity tests with non-target organisms. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of exposure to two common pharmaceuticals in the midge Chironomus riparius in spiked sediment experiments. The selected pharmaceuticals are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID): diclofenac (DF) and the anti-depressant drug carbamazepine (CBZ). In order to assess the effects of the pharmaceuticals, a chronic toxicity test with the midge was carried out. The endpoints survival, growth and developmental stage by means of biomass, were measured after 10 days, and emergence rates and sex-ratio (male/female) were measured after 21 days of exposure. Significant mortality was observed in organisms at day 10 with a 40% of larvae surviving in the highest exposure concentration of CBZ. DF decreased the emergence ratio with respect to the controls in organisms exposed at concentrations of 34.0 μg·g− 1whereas CBZ reduced the growth of the midges (30,6% with respect to the control) and induced a significant change in sex-ratio at concentrations of 31.4 μg·g− 1. The results obtained in the present study indicate possible adverse effects on aquatic invertebrates, which should be taken into account for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceutical compounds in sediments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Nieto Elena; Corada-Fernández Carmen; Hampel Miriam; Lara-Martín Pablo A.; Sánchez-Argüello Paloma; Blasco Julián,Instituto de Ciencias Marinas de Andalucía (ICMAN-CSIC)\Campus Universitario Rio San Pedro\Spain; Facultad de Ciencias del Mar y Ambientales\Universidad de Cádiz (UCA)\Spain; Instituto Universitario de Investigación Marina (INMAR)\Campus de Excelencia Internacional del Mar (CEI•MAR)\Spain; Laboratorio de Ecotoxicologia\Departamento de Medio Ambiente\Spain,-,Carbamazepine; Chironomus riparius; Chronic toxicity; Diclofenac; Pharmaceuticals; Sediment toxicity
274.html,Performance assessment of individual and ensemble data-mining techniques for gully erosion modeling,"Gully erosion is identified as an important sediment source in a range of environments and plays a conclusive role in redistribution of eroded soils on a slope. Hence, addressing spatial occurrence pattern of this phenomenon is very important. Different ensemble models and their single counterparts, mostly data mining methods, have been used for gully erosion susceptibility mapping; however, their calibration and validation procedures need to be thoroughly addressed. The current study presents a series of individual and ensemble data mining methods including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), maximum entropy (ME), ANN-SVM, ANN-ME, and SVM-ME to map gully erosion susceptibility in Aghemam watershed, Iran. To this aim, a gully inventory map along with sixteen gully conditioning factors was used. A 70:30% randomly partitioned sets were used to assess goodness-of-fit and prediction power of the models. The robustness, as the stability of models' performance in response to changes in the dataset, was assessed through three training/test replicates. As a result, conducted preliminary statistical tests showed that ANN has the highest concordance and spatial differentiation with a chi-square value of 36,656 at 95% confidence level, while the ME appeared to have the lowest concordance (1772). The ME model showed an impractical result where 45% of the study area was introduced as highly susceptible to gullying, in contrast, ANN-SVM indicated a practical result with focusing only on 34% of the study area. Through all three replicates, the ANN-SVM ensemble showed the highest goodness-of-fit and predictive power with a respective values of 0.897 (area under the success rate curve) and 0.879 (area under the prediction rate curve), on average, and correspondingly the highest robustness. This attests the important role of ensemble modeling in congruently building accurate and generalized models which emphasizes the necessity to examine different models integrations. The result of this study can prepare an outline for further biophysical designs on gullies scattered in the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pourghasemi Hamid Reza; Yousefi Saleh; Kornejady Aiding; Cerdà Artemi,Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Engineering\College of Agriculture\Iran; Department of Watershed Management Engineering\Faculty of Natural Resources\Iran; Department of Watershed Management Engineering\Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources\Iran; Soil Erosion and Degradation Research Group\Departament de Geografia\Spain,-,ANN; Goodness-of-fit; MaxEnt; Prediction power; Robustness; SVM; Vulnerability
275.html,Modifying sulfomethylated alkali lignin by horseradish peroxidase to improve the dispersibility and conductivity of polyaniline,"Pine and wheat straw alkali lignin (PAL and WAL) were sulfomethylated to improve water solubility, polymerized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to improve the molecular weight (Mw) and applied to dope and disperse polyaniline (PANI). The structural effect of lignin from different origins on the reactivities of sulfomethylation and HRP polymerization was investigated. The results show that WAL with less methoxyl groups and lower Mwhave higher reactivity in sulfomethylation (SWAL). More phenolic hydroxyl groups and lower Mwbenefit the HRP polymerization of sulfomethylated PAL (SPAL). Due to the natural three-dimensional aromatic structure and introduced sulfonic groups, SPAL and SWAL could effectively dope and disperse PANI in water by π-π stacking and electrostatic interaction. HRP modified SPAL (HRP-SPAL) with much higher sulfonation degree and larger Mwsignificantly increased the conductivity and dispersibility of lignin/PANI composites.                          © 2017",Yang Dongjie; Huang Wenjing; Qiu Xueqing; Lou Hongming; Qian Yong,School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\South China University of Technology\China; State Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Engineering\South China University of Technology\China,-,Alkali lignin; Composites; Doping and dispersing; Polyaniline
276.html,Boron and oxygen-codoped porous carbon as efficient oxygen reduction catalysts,"A low-cost boron- and oxygen-codoped porous carbon electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been fabricated by a facile one-step pyrolysis approach, while a boron- and oxygen-rich polymer network was used as precursor. The boron- and oxygen-codoped carbon catalyst with high ORR electrocatalytic activity is comparable to that of Pt/C and is superior to that of catalysts doped solely with boron atoms or with oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the optimized boron- and oxygen-codoped carbon catalyst possesses excellent methanol tolerance and long-term durability in alkaline media. The high electrocatalytic activity of the dual-doped carbon catalysts can be attributed to the synergistic effects of high surface area, predominant mesostructure, abundant active oxygen-containing groups, and effective boron doping. The present results show that this boron- and oxygen-codoping strategy could be as a promising way for the preparation of highly efficient ORR catalysts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lei Zhidan; Chen Hongbiao; Yang Mei; Yang Duanguang; Li Huaming,College of Chemistry\Xiangtan University\China; Key Laboratory of Polymeric Materials & Application Technology of Hunan Province\Xiangtan University\China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Functional Polymeric Materials of College of Hunan Province\Xiangtan University\China,-,Boron- and oxygen-codoped; Electrocatalysts; Fuel cells; ORR; Polymeric networks
277.html,"NOx, NH3, N2O and PN real driving emissions from a Euro VI heavy-duty vehicle. Impact of regulatory on-road test conditions on emissions","Euro VI emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) introduced for the first time limits for solid particle number (PN) and NH3emissions. EU regulation also includes a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) based test at type approval, followed by in-service conformity (ISC) testing. A comprehensive study on the real-time on-road emissions of NOx, NH3, N2O and PN from a Euro VI HDV equipped with a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), a Diesel Particle Filter (DPF), a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and an Ammonia Oxidation Catalyst (AMOX) is presented. Our analyses revealed that up to 85% of the NOxemissions measured during the tests performed are not taken into consideration if the boundary conditions for data exclusion set in the current legislation are applied. Moreover, it was found that the highest NOxemissions were measured during urban operation. Analyses show that a large fraction urban of operation is not considered when 20% power threshold as boundary condition is applied. They also show that cold start emissions account for a large fraction of the total NOxemitted. Low emissions of PN (2.8 × 1010to 6.5 × 1010#/kWh) and NH3(1.0 to 2.2 ppm) were obtained during the on-road tests, suggesting effectiveness of the vehicle's after-treatment (DPF and AMOX). Finally, a comparison between speed-based (as currently defined by Euro VI legislation) and land-use-based (using Geographic Information System (GIS)) calculation of shares of operation was performed. Results suggest that using GIS to categorize the shares of operation could result in different interpretations depending on the criteria adopted for their definition. © 2017 The Authors",Mendoza-Villafuerte Pablo; Suarez-Bertoa Ricardo; Giechaskiel Barouch; Riccobono Francesco; Bulgheroni Claudia; Astorga Covadonga; Perujo Adolfo,European Commission Joint Research Centre\Directorate for Energy\Italy,-,Ammonia; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrous oxide; Particle number; PEMS; Vehicle emissions
278.html,DFT-D study of adsorption of diaminoethane and propylamine molecules on anatase (101) TiO2surface,"The adsorption on anatase (101) TiO2surface of two model amines, diaminoethane (DAE) and propylamine (PPA), was investigated using Density Functional Theory-Dispersion included (DFT-D) calculations. The investigated coverage is ranging from 0.25 monolayer to full coverage (one amine molecule per surface Ti ion). Both interactions of the adsorbed layer with the anatase (101) TiO2surface and intermolecular interactions are described. A structural transition from a bridge to a perpendicular structure is found for DAE when evolving from 0.25 monolayer to full coverage. At full coverage, a dense, ordered adhesive layer is formed. For DAE, at intermediate coverage, different isoenergetic configurations are found and structural transition from a bridge to a perpendicular structure is found. In contrast, the adsorption mode of PPA is more regular with only perpendicularly adsorbed molecules at all investigated coverages. Dispersion forces already account for 40% of the adsorption energy at low coverage (0.25 ML) and are the driving force for monolayer formation with a contribution of 60% up to 100% at high coverage. As revealed by molecular dynamics, the molecules can change their orientation towards the surface in a concerted way.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Chimie-ParisTech—CNRS\IRCP\France; CIRIMAT\Université de Toulouse\France; LAAS-CNRS\Equipe M3 7\France; Consorzio INSTM UdR di Roma SEDE: Dipartimento di Chimica\Università di Roma “La Sapienza”\Italy,-,Adhesion; Amine; Cohesive film; DFT-D; Diaminoethane; Propylamine; TiO2

Hierarchical Ni-Co layered double hydroxide nanosheets with network structure were electrodeposited on the ultrathin reduced graphene oxide films in a simple three-electrode system. The thickness of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide nanosheets can be controlled through adjusting the deposition temperature. The as-prepared electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 1454.2 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor device was designed with the as-prepared composites as positive electrode material and Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide as negative electrode material. This device could be operated in a working voltage range of 0–1.8 V in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, delivering a high energy density of 56.4 W h kg−1at a power density of 882.5 W kg−1. One supercapacitor can power two LEDs with rated voltage of 1.8–2.0 V. After 10,000 consecutive charge-discharge tests at 10 A g−1, this asymmetric supercapacitor revealed an excellent cycle life with 98.3% specific capacitance retention.

280.html,Influence of different impregnation modes on the properties of CuO–CeO2/γ-Al2O3catalysts for NO reduction by CO,"A series of ceria modified CuO/γ-Al2O3(CuO-CeO2/γ-Al2O3) catalysts were prepared via stepwise impregnation (CuCeAl-SI) and co-impregnation (CuCeAl-CI) method and tested in the model reaction of NO reduction by CO. It was found that the influence of impregnation modes on the catalytic properties of CuCeAl samples mainly lies on the control of ceria particle sizes and modulation of the distribution of various copper species. In both impregnation modes, ceria was mainly spread on γ-Al2O3as small particles while copper species were highly dispersed. A quantitative estimation of copper species was tentatively provided via a combined surface acid leaching experiment and H2-TPR characterization for the first time. The results showed that for CuCeAl-CI catalyst, about 55% and 25% copper species were dispersed on γ-Al2O3and nanosized ceria, respectively, while about 20% was migrated into ceria lattice during the calcination process. In contrast, in CuCeAl-SI sample, the corresponding values changed to about 25%, 70% and 5%, respectively. The synergistic effect between copper species and ceria can promote the improvement of catalytic performance, which results in higher activity of CuCeAl-SI than that of CuCeAl-CI catalyst.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sun Jingfang; Ge Chengyan; Yao Xiaojiang; Zou Weixin; Hong Xi; Tang Changjin; Dong Lin,Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Vehicle Emissions Control\School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\China; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Yancheng Institute of Technology\China; Research Center for Atmospheric Environment\Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology\China; School of Environmental Sciences and Engineering\Nanjing Tech University\China,-,Co-impregnation; CuO–CeO2/γ-A12O3; Impregnation modes; NO + CO; Stepwise impregnation

The fluctuant woven fabric and the fluffy spherical SiO2nanoparticles constructed a dual micro/nano-structures. The surface free energy of the fabric composite was reduced by FOTS modifier. The interplay of the structured and perfluorinated SiO2nanoparticles could not only endow the fabric highly liquid repellent ability, but could also to enhance the coating stability.

284.html,Characterization of a managed aquifer recharge system using multiple tracers,"Knowledge about the residence times of artificially infiltrated water into an aquifer and the resulting flow paths is essential to developing groundwater-management schemes. To obtain this knowledge, a variety of tracers can be used to study residence times and gain information about subsurface processes. Although a variety of tracers exists, their interpretation can differ considerably due to subsurface heterogeneity, underlying assumptions, and sampling and analysis limitations. The current study systematically assesses information gained from seven different tracers during a pumping experiment at a site where drinking water is extracted from an aquifer close to contaminated areas and where groundwater is artificially recharged by infiltrating surface water. We demonstrate that the groundwater residence times estimated using dye and heat tracers are comparable when the thermal retardation for the heat tracer is considered. Furthermore, major ions, acesulfame, and stable isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) show that mixing of infiltrated water and groundwater coming from the regional flow path occurred and a vertical stratification of the flow system exist. Based on the concentration patterns of dissolved gases (He, Ar, Kr, N2, and O2) and chlorinated solvents (e.g., tetrachloroethene), three temporal phases are observed in the ratio between infiltrated water and regional groundwater during the pumping experiment. Variability in this ratio is significantly related to changes in the pumping and infiltration rates. During constant pumping rates, more infiltrated water was extracted, which led to a higher dilution of the regional groundwater. An infiltration interruption caused however, the ratio to change and more regional groundwater is extracted, which led to an increase in all concentrations. The obtained results are discussed for each tracer considered and its strengths and limitations are illustrated. Overall, it is demonstrated that aquifer heterogeneity and various subsurface processes necessitate application of multiple tracers to quantify uncertainty when identifying flow processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Moeck Christian; Radny Dirk; Popp Andrea; Brennwald Matthias; Stoll Sebastian; Auckenthaler Adrian; Berg Michael; Schirmer Mario,Eawag\Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology\Switzerland; Office of Environmental Protection and Energy\Canton Basel-Country\Switzerland; Department of Environmental Systems Science\ETH Zurich\Switzerland; Centre of Hydrogeology and Geothermics (CHYN)\University of Neuchâtel\Switzerland,-,Acesulfame; Groundwater residence time; Managed aquifer recharge; Noble gases; Time series; Urban hydrogeology
285.html,"Hybrid biocomposites based on titania nanotubes and a hydroxyapatite coating deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering: Surface topography, structure, and mechanical properties","In this study, biocomposites based on porous titanium oxide structures and a calcium phosphate (CaP) or hydroxyapatite (HA) coating are described and prepared. Nanotubes (NTs) with different pore dimensions were processed using anodic oxidation of Ti substrates in a NH4F-containing electrolyte solution at anodization voltages of 30 and 60 V with a DC power supply. The external diameters of the nanotubes prepared at 30 V and 60 V were 53 ± 10 and 98 ± 16 nm, respectively. RF-magnetron sputtering of the HA target in a single deposition run was performed to prepare a coating on the surface of TiO2NTs prepared at 30 and 60 V. The thickness of the CaP coating deposited on the mirror-polished Si substrate in the same deposition run with TiO2NTs was determined by optical ellipsometry (SE) 95 ± 5 nm. Uncoated and CaP-coated NTs were annealed at 500 °C in air. Afterwards, the presence of TiO2(anatase) was observed. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nanoindentation results revealed the influence that the NT dimensions had on the CaP coating deposition process. The tubular surfaces of the NTs were completely coated with the HA coating when prepared at 30 V, and no homogeneous CaP coating was observed when prepared at 60 V. The XRD patterns show peaks assigned to crystalline HA only for the coated TiO2NTs prepared at 30 V. High-resolution XPS spectra show binding energies (BE) of Ca 2p, P 2p and O 1s core-levels corresponding to HA and amorphous calcium phosphate on TiO2NTs prepared at 30 V and 60 V, respectively. Fabrication of TiO2NTs results in a significant decrease to the elastic modulus and nanohardness compared to the Ti substrate. The porous structure of the NTs causes an increase in the elastic strain to failure of the coating (H/E) and the parameter used to describe the resistance of the material to plastic deformation (H3/E2) at the nanoscale level compared to the Ti substrate. Furthermore, only the HA coating on the NTs exhibits a significantly increased H/E ratio and H3/E2factor compared to the NTs and Ti substrate. Increases in resistance to penetration for the indenter were also observed for HA-coated TiO2NTs prepared at 30 V compared to uncoated and CaP-coated NTs prepared at 60 V.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chernozem Roman V.; Surmeneva Maria A.; Krause Bärbel; Baumbach Tilo; Ignatov Viktor P.; Tyurin Alexander I.; Loza Kateryna; Epple Matthias; Surmenev Roman A.,Centre of Technology\Department of Experimental Physics\Russian Federation; ANKA/Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation (IPS)\Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\Germany; Laboratory for Applications of Synchrotron Radiation (LAS)\Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)\Germany; Department of Silicate Technology and Nanomaterials\National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University\Russian Federation,-,Amorphous calcium phosphate; Bone tissue engineering; Hydroxyapatite; Magnetron sputtering; Nanohardness; Titanium oxide nanotubes; Young's modulus

The effects of exposure to biosolids containing transformation products of these ENMs at low concentrations remain largely unexplored. We examined the responses of Medicago truncatula and its symbiotic rhizobia Sinorhizobium meliloti exposed to soil amended with biosolids from WWTP containing low added concentrations of ENMs (ENM Low), bulk/dissolved metals (bulk/dissolved Low), or no metal additions (control). We targeted adding approximately 5 mg/kg of Ag and 50 mg/kg of Zn, and Ti. Measured endpoints included M. truncatula growth, nodulation, changes in the expression of stress response genes, uptake of metals (Ag, Zn and Ti) into shoots, and quantification of S. meliloti populations and soil microbial communities. After 30 days exposure, no effects on root or shoot biomass were observed in ENM Low and bulk/dissolved Low treatments, whereas both treatments had a larger average number of nodules (5.7 and 5.57, respectively) compared to controls (0.33). There were no significant differences in either total accumulated metal or metal concentrations in shoots among the treatments. Expression of five stress-related genes (metal tolerance protein (MTP), metal transporter (MTR), peroxidase (PEROX), NADPH oxidase (NADPH) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase-like protein (ACC_Oxidase)) was significantly down-regulated in both bulk/dissolved Low and ENM Low treatments. However, a change in soil microbial community composition and a significant increase in total microbial biomass were observed in ENM Low relative to control. The ENM Low treatment had increased abundance of Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria and reduced abundance of eukaryotes compared to control. The study demonstrated that although there were some subtle shifts in microbial community composition, plant health was minimally impacted by ENMs within the time frame and at the low exposure concentrations used in this study. © 2017",Chen Chun; Tsyusko Olga V.; McNear Dave H.; Judy Jonathan; Lewis Ricky W.; Unrine Jason M.,State Key Laboratory of Arid Region Crop Stress Biology\Northwestern Agriculture and Forestry University\China; Department of Plant and Soil Sciences\University of Kentucky\United States; Department of Soil and Water Science\University of Florida\United States,-,Biosolids; Microbe; Nanomaterials; Plant; Transformation
287.html,The mechanism and efficiency of MnO2activated persulfate process coupled with electrolysis,"Pure three-dimensional manganese oxides (MnO2) were successfully synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal process. The obtained particles were characterized via XRD, BET, SEM, XPS and FTIR techniques. To enhance the efficiency of heterogeneous catalytic process, a facile and effective electrochemical method was introduced. The degradation of C. I. Acid Orange 7 (AO7) as the target pollutant in aqueous solution by an oxidation system involving MnO2activated peroxydisulfate (PDS) coupled with electrochemical method is reported herein. Influences of some key reaction parameters such as initial pH (pH0), current density, initial AO7 concentration, dosage of MnO2and anions (Cl−, NO3−, HCO3−and H2PO4−) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the charge transfer process occurred at the surface of catalyst. LC-MS/MS analysis was applied to identify degradation intermediates and a plausible degradation mechanism is proposed accordingly. Activated sludge inhibition tests were carried out to evaluate the change of toxicity of the dye solution in the oxidation process. The inorganic by-products such as NO2−, NO3−, and NH4+along with AO7 degradation were also identified. The stability of MnO2catalyst was evaluated by recycling experiments and the electrical energy consumption was also investigated. Radical quenching tests with several scavengers (methanol, tert-butyl alcohol, 1,4-benzoquinone and phenol) were performed to clarify the dominating reactive species participating in this oxidation process and the underlying mechanisms involving the generation of radical from the proposed electro-assisted heterogeneous activated PDS system were identified. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Yin; Lin Heng; Li Yukun; Zhang Hui,Department of Environmental Engineering\Hubei Environmental Remediation Material Engineering Technology Research Center\China; Shenzhen Research Institute of Wuhan University\Shenzhen\China,-,Degradation; Electro-enhanced; MnO2; Persulfate; Reactive radicals
288.html,Response of stream benthic macroinvertebrates to current water management in Alpine catchments massively developed for hydropower,"The present work focuses on evaluating the ecological effects of hydropower-induced streamflow alteration within four catchments in the central Italian Alps. Downstream from the water diversions, minimum flows are released as an environmental protection measure, ranging approximately from 5 to 10% of the mean annual natural flow estimated at the intake section. Benthic macroinvertebrates as well as daily averaged streamflow were monitored for five years at twenty regulated stream reaches, and possible relationships between benthos-based stream quality metrics and environmental variables were investigated. Despite the non-negligible inter-site differences in basic streamflow metrics, benthic macroinvertebrate communities were generally dominated by few highly resilient taxa. The highest level of diversity was detected at sites where upstream minimum flow exceedance is higher and further anthropogenic pressures (other than hydropower) are lower. However, according to the current Italian normative index, the ecological quality was good/high on average at all of the investigated reaches, thus complying the Water Framework Directive standards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Quadroni Silvia; Crosa Giuseppe; Gentili Gaetano; Espa Paolo,Department of Theoretical and Applied Sciences\University of Insubria\Italy; Graia s.r.l.\Via Repubblica 1\Italy; Department of Science and High Technology\University of Insubria\Italy,-,Alpine catchment; Biomonitoring; Environmental flow; Minimum flow; Water Framework Directive; Water management
289.html,Relationship between land-use and sources and fate of nitrate in groundwater in a typical recharge area of the North China Plain,"Identification of different nitrate sources in groundwater is challenging in areas with diverse land use and multiple potential inputs. An area with mixed land-uses, typical of the piedmont-plain recharge area of the North China Plain, was selected to investigate different nitrate sources and the impact of land use on nitrate distribution in groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers were examined, including major ions, stable isotopes of water (δ2H-H2O, δ18O-H2O) and nitrate (δ15N-NO3−and δ18O-NO3−). Groundwater was sampled from four land-use types; natural vegetation (NV), farmland (FL), economic forestland (EF) and residential areas (RA). A mixing model using δ18O and Cl−concentrations showed that groundwater recharge predominantly comprises precipitation and lateral groundwater flow from areas of natural vegetation in the upper catchment, while irrigation return water and wastewater from septic tanks were major inputs in farmland and residential areas, respectively. Land use variation is the major contributing factor to different nitrate concentrations. In total, 80%, 49% and 86% of samples from RA, FL and EF, respectively exceeded the WHO standard (50 mg/L NO3−), compared to 6.9% of samples from NV. Isotopes of δ15N-NO3−and δ18O-NO3−verified that nitrate in groundwater of the NV (with δ15N ranging from 1.7‰ to 4.7‰) was sourced from soil and precipitation. Examination of δ15N-NO3−vs δ18O-NO3−values along with multivariate statistical analysis (principle component and cluster analysis) helped identify sources with overlapping isotopic values in other land-use areas (where δ15N values range from 2.5‰ to 10.2‰). Manure and septic waste were dominant sources for most groundwater with high NO3−and Cl−concentrations in both farmland and residential areas. The lack of de-nitrification and fact that the area is a recharge zone for the North China Plain highlight the importance of controlling nitrate sources through careful application of manure and fertilizers, and control of septic leakage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Shiqin; Zheng Wenbo; Currell Matthew; Yang Yonghui; Zhao Huan; Lv Mengyu,Key Laboratory of Agricultural Water Resources\Center for Agricultural Resources Research\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\19A Yuquan Road\China; School of Engineering\RMIT University\Australia; Satellite Environment Center\Ministry of Environmental Protection\China,-,Land-use; Multivariate statistical analysis; Nitrate in groundwater; Nitrate source; North China Plain; Stable isotopes
29.html,Tradition and innovation within the decoration program of the temple of Ramesses II at Gerf Hussein,"The temple at Gerf Hussein is closely related to the other Lower Nubian speoi of Ramesses II, especially at Abu Simbel, Derr, and Wadi es-Sebua. Like in these earlier temples the gods of the so-called state-triad dominated the temple concept. Important topics therefore were creation and regeneration, as well as the religious and political unity of Egypt. The temple at Gerf Hussein completed the re-structuring of the northern Nubian ritual landscape during the reign of Ramesses II. In each one of the four huge Nubian speoi sacred kingship ideology was an intrinsic part of the temple concept, but the way in which the divine Ramesses dominated the whole decoration program at Gerf Hussein was unprecedented. The most remarkable feature is the predominance of divine groups (mainly triads and quads), no less than 21 of these are to be found along the main axis of the temple. Different divine manifestations of the king are almost always part of these groups. Their multiplicity and variety is another distinct aspect of the temple at Gerf Hussein. Closely related to the king are also the so-called 'gods/goddesses of Ramesses' which play a prominent role within the temple's theology. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

291.html,Evaluating a Bayesian modelling approach (INLA-SPDE) for environmental mapping,"Understanding the uncertainty in spatial modelling of environmental variables is important because it provides the end-users with the reliability of the maps. Over the past decades, Bayesian statistics has been successfully used. However, the conventional simulation-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches are often computationally intensive. In this study, the performance of a novel Bayesian inference approach called Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (INLA-SPDE) was evaluated using independent calibration and validation datasets of various skewed and non-skewed soil properties and was compared with a linear mixed model estimated by residual maximum likelihood (REML-LMM). It was found that INLA-SPDE was equivalent to REML-LMM in terms of the model performance and was similarly robust with sparse datasets (i.e. 40–60 samples). In comparison, INLA-SPDE was able to estimate the posterior marginal distributions of the model parameters without extensive simulations. It was concluded that INLA-SPDE had the potential to map the spatial distribution of environmental variables along with their posterior marginal distributions for environmental management. Some drawbacks were identified with INLA-SPDE, including artefacts of model response due to the use of triangle meshes and a longer computational time when dealing with non-Gaussian likelihood families. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Huang Jingyi; Malone Brendan P.; Minasny Budiman; McBratney Alex B.; Triantafilis John,Sydney Institute of Agriculture & School of Life and Environmental Sciences\The University of Sydney\Australia; School of Biological\Earth and Environmental Sciences\Australia,-,Elevation; Gamma-ray spectrometry; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Sample size; Stochastic partial differential equation; X-ray fluorescent

Generating additional chronic toxicity data for the refinement of safe environmental exposure concentrations in the US and Europe,"The freshwater and marine long-term ecotoxicity datasets used in the European REACH registration dossiers for molybdenum and molybdenum compounds resulted in the derivation of a HC5,50%,freshwater(38.2 mg Mo/L) and HC5,50%,marine(5.70 mg Mo/L) by means of the statistical extrapolation method. Both datasets, however, did not meet the US-EPA information requirements for deriving Final Chronic Values (FCV) that were based on chronic data. US-EPA compliance was achieved by generating chronic no-effect data for the freshwater benthic amphipod Hyalella azteca and the marine inland silverside fish Menidia beryllina, using sodium molybdate dihydrate as test substance. A 42d-EC10of 44.6 mg Mo/L for reproduction was determined in a water-only exposure with H. azteca. For M. beryllina, a 37d-NOEC of 139 mg mMo/L for standard length and blotted wet weight was found. Other endpoints (e.g., survival, hatching success) proved to be less sensitive. Data were added to the existing chronic toxicity datasets, together with new long-term no-effect values that were identified in open literature for brown trout Salmo trutta, the marine alga Isochrysis galbana, the marine snail Nassarius dorsatus and the marine barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. The updated data sets resulted in a freshwater and marine HC5,50%of 35.7 and 6.85 mg Mo/L, respectively. The same data sets were also used for the determination of US-EPA FCVs, where the FVCfreshwaterwas 36.1 mg/L, and the FCVmarinewas 3.85 mg Mo/L. As the Final Plant Values for both aquatic environments were higher than their respective FCVs, the Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) for molybdenum is equal to the FCV. © 2017 The Authors",-,ARCHE Consulting\Liefkensstraat 35d\Belgium; International Molybdenum Association\454–458 Chiswick High Road\United Kingdom,-,FCV derivation; Freshwater assessment; Marine assessment; Molybdate; PNEC derivation
293.html,Predicting diffuse microbial pollution risk across catchments: The performance of SCIMAP and recommendations for future development,"Microbial pollution of surface waters in agricultural catchments can be a consequence of poor farm management practices, such as excessive stocking of livestock on vulnerable land or inappropriate handling of manures and slurries. Catchment interventions such as fencing of watercourses, streamside buffer strips and constructed wetlands have the potential to reduce faecal pollution of watercourses. However these interventions are expensive and occupy valuable productive land. There is, therefore, a requirement for tools to assist in the spatial targeting of such interventions to areas where they will have the biggest impact on water quality improvements whist occupying the minimal amount of productive land. SCIMAP is a risk-based model that has been developed for this purpose but with a focus on diffuse sediment and nutrient pollution. In this study we investigated the performance of SCIMAP in predicting microbial pollution of watercourses and assessed modelled outputs of E. coli, a common faecal indicator organism (FIO), against observed water quality information. SCIMAP was applied to two river catchments in the UK. SCIMAP uses land cover risk weightings, which are routed through the landscape based on hydrological connectivity to generate catchment scale maps of relative in-stream pollution risk. Assessment of the model's performance and derivation of optimum land cover risk weightings was achieved using a Monte-Carlo sampling approach. Performance of the SCIMAP framework for informing on FIO risk was variable with better performance in the Yealm catchment (rs= 0.88; p < 0.01) than the Wyre (rs= − 0.36; p > 0.05). Across both catchments much uncertainty was associated with the application of optimum risk weightings attributed to different land use classes. Overall, SCIMAP showed potential as a useful tool in the spatial targeting of FIO diffuse pollution management strategies; however, improvements are required to transition the existing SCIMAP framework to a robust FIO risk-mapping tool. © 2017 The Authors",Porter Kenneth D.H.; Reaney Sim M.; Quilliam Richard S.; Burgess Chris; Oliver David M.,Biological & Environmental Sciences\Faculty of Natural Sciences\United Kingdom; Department of Geography\Durham University\United Kingdom; Environment Agency\King's Meadow House\United Kingdom,-,Decision support; E. coli; Faecal indicator organism; Hydrological connectivity; Non-point source pollution; Runoff
294.html,"Leaf morphological variability and intraspecific taxonomic units for pedunculate oak and grayish oak (genus Quercus L., series Pedunculatae Schwz.) in Southern Carpathian Region (Romania)","Even though pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and grayish oak (Quercus pedunculiflora K. Koch) have different ecological requirements, they have been considered as having low differentiation at the level of morphological traits and genetic variation. The leaf morphology for 862 trees has been assessed in 16 natural populations, seven of Q. robur, eight of Q. pedunculiflora and a mixed forest were both taxa coexist. In total, fifteen descriptors have been analysed by using discriminant analysis, while it was found that with only four out of the fifteen leaf traits (abaxial pubescence, abaxial colour of the leaf, petiole length and basal shape of lamina) the two taxa could be clearly differentiated. A dendrogram has been constructed on the basis of these traits, where the populations of each taxon have been clustered together. PU and CL traits of Q. pedunculiflora were discussed for their adaptive value for drought resistance in the steppe habitats occupied by this taxon. Using the leaves’ morphological descriptors and data from the literature, intra-taxonomic units (varieties, forms and sub-forms) have been identified in all analysed populations. Eight intraspecific units for Q. robur and six for Q. pedunculiflora have been identified in the investigated area. An analysis of spatial distribution of the two taxa and of their intraspecific units has been performed using maps of ecoregions for the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Apostol Ecaterina Nicoleta; Curtu Alexandru Lucian; Daia Liviu Mihai; Apostol Bogdan; Dinu Cristiana Georgeta; Şofletea Neculae,National Institute for Research and Development in Forestry (INCDS) “Marin Drăcea”\Eroilor No. 128\Romania; “Transilvania” University of Braşov\Brașov\Romania; National Forest Administration – ROMSILVA\Petricani Street\Romania,-,Intraspecific units; Leaf descriptors; Quercus pedunculiflora; Quercus robur; Series Pedunculatae; Taxonomy
295.html,Perceived usefulness of personal protective equipment in pesticide use predicts farmers' willingness to use it,"Personal protective equipment (PPE) can substantially reduce the risk exposure from pesticide spraying, but compliance is rather low, particularly among small-scale farmers. In this study the connection between farmers' willingness to use PPE in pesticide handling and perceptions of PPE usefulness was examined through a survey of 341 small-scale farmers in Gorgan county of Golestan Province, Iran. Farmers who were not using PPE when working with pesticides were purposively selected to better serve the objective of the study. Multinomial logit regression models were employed to examine differences in farmers' willingness to use PPE in the future. Almost four out of ten farmers (38.1%) showed willingness to use PPE. However, 36.7% of the farmers showed unwillingness and 25.2% were unsure about using PPE. The average score of farmers' perceptions of PPE disadvantages (x = 0.55) was significantly higher than the corresponding score of PPE advantages (x = 0.38). Low availability and high price were considered the most important constraints in PPE use by the majority of farmers (75.4% and 74.8% of the farmers, respectively). Farmers who perceived usefulness of PPE, such as effectiveness, safety, and ease of use, were more willing to use PPE in the future. Those who perceived non-usefulness of PPE, driven by unavailability, high price, lack of use by neighbors or colleagues, and ignorance of PPE in extension trainings, were less likely to use PPE in the future. Findings revealed that willingness to use PPE among small-scale farmers when working with pesticides is strongly linked to their perception of PPE usefulness. Findings raise our understanding of the important role of farmers' knowledge in PPE acceptance and use and can motivate policy-makers to pay more attention to the role of farmers' perceptions and awareness in the success or failure of health and safety programs. It is necessary to incorporate farmers' preferences in extension programs to promote safety measures during working with pesticides. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sharifzadeh Mohammad Sharif; Damalas Christos A.; Abdollahzadeh Gholamhossein,Department of Agricultural Extension and Education\Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources\Iran; Department of Agricultural Development\Democritus University of Thrace\Greece,-,Extension; Knowledge; Personal protection; Pesticide hazards; Safety measures

297.html,Land use change effects on ecosystem carbon budget in the Sichuan Basin of Southwest China: Conversion of cropland to forest ecosystem,"In the humid subtropics, conversion of cropland to forest has been recognized to influence carbon cycling (e.g., soil CO2emissions) and the associated ecosystem carbon balance. A three-year field study was conducted in situ to quantitatively evaluate effects of land use change on carbon budget in a cropland (under winter wheat-summer maize rotation) comparison with the adjacent forest ecosystem. During the three-year experimental period, on average, soil heterotrophic respirations were 35.19 mg C·m− 2·h− 1for the cropland and 40.02 mg C·m− 2·h− 1for the adjacent forest ecosystem. The quantified net primary production (NPP) were 8724.78 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1for the cropland (3218.14 kg C·ha− 1for winter wheat season and 5506.64 kg C·ha− 1for summer maize season) and 6478.99 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1for the adjacent forest ecosystem. Thus, the average positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 5139.33 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1and 2790.43 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1were gained in the cropland and the adjacent forest ecosystem, respectively. Nonetheless, if take into consideration of crop grain harvest (i.e., removal), the mean NEP was only 976.69 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1for cropland which were over three-fold lower than for the adjacent forest ecosystem. The practice of conversion of cropland (maize-wheat rotation system) to forest consequently resulted in an average annual net carbon sequestration of 1813.74 kg C·ha− 1·year− 1in the study. Therefore, our findings highlight that practices of conversion of subtropical cropland to forest commonly conducted in the last decades act as sinks of atmospheric CO2in southwest China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Xiaoguo; Zhou Minghua; Li Tao; Ke Yun; Zhu Bo,Key Laboratory of Mountain Surface Processes and Ecological Regulation\Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment Research\China; Institute of Bio- and Geosciences – Agrosphere (IBG-3)\Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH\Germany,-,Carbon balance; Land use change; Net primary productivity; Soil organic carbon
298.html,Vancomycin-resistant enterococci with vanA gene in treated municipal wastewater and their association with human hospital strains,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are pathogens of increasing medical importance. In Brno, Czech Republic, we collected 37 samples from the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), 21 surface swabs from hospital settings, and 59 fecal samples from hospitalized patients and staff. Moreover, we collected 284 gull cloacal swabs from the colony situated 35 km downstream the WWTP. Samples were cultured selectively. Enterococci were identified using MALDI-TOF MS, phenotypically tested for susceptibility to antibiotics, and by PCR for occurrence of resistance and virulence genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were used to examine genotypic diversity. VRE carrying the vanA gene were found in 32 (86%, n = 37) wastewater samples, from which we obtained 49 isolates: Enterococcus faecium (44) and Enterococcus gallinarum (2), Enterococcus casseliflavus (2), and Enterococcus raffinosus (1). From 33 (69%) of 48 inpatient stool samples, we obtained 39 vanA-carrying VRE, which belonged to E. faecium (33 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (4), and Enterococcus raffinosus (2). Nearly one-third of the samples from hospital surfaces contained VRE with the vanA gene. VRE were not detected among gulls. Sixty-seven (84%, n = 80) E. faecium isolates carried virulence genes hyl and/or esp. Virulence of E. faecalis was encoded by gelE, asa1, and cylA genes. A majority of the E. faecium isolates belonged to the clinically important sequence types ST17 (WWTP: 10 isolates; hospital: 4 isolates), ST18 (9;8), and ST78 (5;0). The remaining isolates belonged to ST555 (2;0), ST262 (1;6), ST273 (3;0), ST275 (1;0), ST549 (2;0), ST19 (0;1), ST323 (3;0), and ST884 (7;17). Clinically important enterococci carrying the vanA gene were almost continually detectable in the effluent of the WWTP, indicating insufficient removal of VRE during wastewater treatment and permanent shedding of these antibiotic resistant pathogens into the environment from this source. This represents a risk of their transmission to the environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Oravcova Veronika; Mihalcin Matus; Zakova Jana; Pospisilova Lucie; Masarikova Martina; Literak Ivan,Department of Biology and Wildlife Diseases\Faculty of Veterinary Hygiene and Ecology\Czech Republic; Department of Infectious Diseases\University Hospital Brno\Czech Republic; Faculty of Medicine\Masaryk University\Czech Republic; CEITEC VFU\University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno\Czech Republic,-,Antibiotic resistance; Clostridium difficile; Glycopeptides; Gull; Hospital; Wastewater treatment plant
299.html,Characteristics and applications of ecological soil substrate for rocky slope vegetation in cold and high-altitude areas,"Ecological restoration of steep rocky slopes generated by road cutting is usually difficult especially, in the cold and high-altitude environment, which is unfavorable for the growth of vegetation. With the focus on slope vegetation, an ecological soil substrate, synthesized with polyacrylamide (PAM), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and Fly ash (FA) as the main components, was developed for spray seeding on the rocky slopes in cold and high-altitude regions, to provide a favorable environment for vegetation growth. The compositional effect of individual compound addition on the growth of vegetation and substrate properties was investigated using an orthogonal array experimental design. Based on ANOVA and orthogonal analysis, an ecological soil substrate (PCF) with 400 g/m3PAM, 600 g/m3CMC, 1500 g/m3FA, and 50 L/m3of water was decided as the optimum PCF substrate. The optimum PCF substrate was then sprayed on a steep rocky slope in a cold and high-altitude region in Sichuan, China, for two years. The vegetation, as well as the physico-chemical properties, nutrient content, and mechanical properties of the field soil substrate, were examined over this duration. The field verification shows that the proposed PCF substrate is able to provide desirable nutrient contents and excellent physical and mechanical properties for vegetating the steep rocky slopes in cold and high-altitude areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Hua; Li Tian-Bin; Chen Jian-Nan; Liu Chia-Nan; Zhou Xiong-hua; Xia Lei,Key Laboratory of High-Speed Railway Engineering\Ministry of Education\China; State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection\Chengdu University of Technology\China; Department of Geoscience and Environmental Engineering\Southwest Jiaotong University\China; Department of Civil Engineering\National Chi-Nan University\Taiwan,-,Cold and high-altitude; Rocky slope; Substrate; Synthesized soil; Vegetation

Building on Streeck’s (2009) explorations of depiction by gesture, we examine how this speaker’s process of exposition involves sequences of multimodal, analogical depiction by which the philosophical concepts are not only expressed through gesture forms, but also dynamically analyzed and construed through gestural activity. Drawing on perspectives of gesture as active meaning making (Müller 2014, 2016, Streeck 2009), we argue that the build-up of gestures in depiction sequences, activated through a multimodal metaphor (Müller & Cienki 2009), engages the wider philosophical standpoint of the speaker. Using video analysis supported by interview data, we demonstrate how examination of gestures within and across discourse can lead to understanding of how dynamic, embodied, and subjective processes of conceptualization contribute to philosophical theorizing. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",Paul Stevens Michael; Harrison Simon,School of English\University of Nottingham Ningbo China\China; Department of English\City University of Hong Kong\Hong Kong,-,conceptualization; construal; depiction; gesture; philosophy

Anastasi I 28.5-6 (c. 1200 BC), in which a critique about the style of a scribe is included: '[your narratives] are like the talk of a man of the Delta with a man of Elephantine'. Owing to the fact that vowels are not written in the Egyptian texts previous to the Coptic period and that, as a consequence, dialectal features were not generally represented, knowledge of ancient Egyptian dialects has traditionally been based on Coptic texts. However, Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names not only reflect the pronunciation and reveal the vocalization of Egyptian words, but also contain many dialectal features that can help us to establish some dialectal isoglosses five centuries before the appearance of Coptic texts. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

Trivalent As (As(III)), pentavalent As (As(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AsB) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) were found in all urine samples. Only As(III) and As(V) were detected in saliva samples. In nail and hair samples, DMA, MMA, As(III) and As(V) were observed. Based on total As contents in crops and drinking water, the local residents’ daily intake of total arsenic (TDIAs), the hazard quotient (HQ), and the cancer risk (R) were assessed. Male, older and cases of skin lesion participants generally had higher As contents in saliva, urine, nail and hair samples in relative to others. Salivary, urinary, nail and hair As were not significantly affected by body mass index (BMI) and smoking. Good correlations were observed between TDIAsand salivary, urinary, nail and hair As, showing that saliva, urine, nail and hair samples can be used as biomarkers of As exposure. Individually, levels of arsenicosis were positively correlated with TDIAs. The relationship between TDIAsand prevalence of arsenicosis concluded that, although As levels in crops and drinking water did not exceed national standards, they still pose a potential threat to human health. It was suggested that the maximum permissible levels of crop As and drinking water As should be re-evaluated for protecting human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Ting; Guo Huaming; Xiu Wei; Wei Chao; Li Xiaomeng; Di Zhen; Song Wei,State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology\China University of Geosciences (Beijing)\China; School of Water Resources and Environment\China University of Geosciences (Beijing)\China; The National Institute of Metrology\Beijing\China; Hangjinhouqi Center of Diseases Prevention and Control\Shanba\China,-,Arsenic; China; Chronic poisoning; Food chain; Groundwater; Saliva

To achieve this, the Angolan Government, since the end of the war in 2002, launched the challenge of diversifying its economy by using all available resources in various areas of economic, social and cultural life. It is in this perspective that the Angolan public cultural policy adopted in 2011, recognizes the cultural and natural heritage, especially the archaeological heritage as one of the pillars of sustainable development of Angola with immediate effects on the internal cohesion of local communities in building a united nation and prosperous. Despite the existence of a rich and diverse archaeological heritage (rock art sites, burial archaeological sites, museum collection, etc.) and taking into account the threats due to the Angola's economic growth, this ideal can only be achieved if in fact the public policies for managing this heritage are consolidated, since the training of managers, the reinforcement of measures for protection, preservation and management of sites, the development of research and promotion consistent policies, the development of decentralized and participative management strategies that involve not only local authorities but especially local communities and other civil society partners. © Archaeopress, UISPP and authors 2017.

303.html,The Italian-Egyptian Mission at the Monastery of Abba Nefer at Manqabad: Results of the first four seasons' work,"The Italian-Egyptian project at the Monastery of Abba Nefer at Manqabad started in 2011. The first three campaigns, carried out between 2011 and 2013, were actually brief surveys, strongly affected by the political instability of the country. During these surveys, the mission identified most of the structures already brought to light and recorded by previous investigations. Finally, during the campaign of autumn 2014, it was possible to work longer and to start the topographical survey and the investigation of the numerous structures still extant on the site. The town wall, overall enclosing an area of about 92.000 square meters, was acquired and measured with a Total Station. From the satellite images of the site, it was possible to identify a series of alignments in the NW quarter of the site, running EW at an average distance of 25m from each other. These alignments are very likely to correspond to the foundations or the lower courses of buildings for military cantonment of the Roman phase. Differently from monumental buildings of Roman time and churches of the early Christian period in Egypt, which were the object of in-depth studies during the last century, and are rather well known, the domestic architecture of the early Christian time still deserves further attention. For this reason, the mission put a particular focus on the Northern Sector of the site, characterized by a long row of housing units - 90 were recorded - and a first typology was set up. During the same season, the study of the previously discovered findings was also started. From the analysis of the two inventories kept in el-Ashmunein and Asyut (Shutbi), it was possible to determine the number and nature of all the findings and their conservation status. Unfortunately, however, only very vague information exist on the systems of grids and squares used by previous excavators and on the provenance of these findings. After the inventory survey, the study of the materials was undertaken at el-Ashmunein, where 152 specimens were analysed, catalogued and photographed. The preliminary observation of the finds (especially ceramics, paintings and architectural elements) and inscriptions allowed us to suggest an outline of the history of the site, divided into three main phases of life and at least three others of less regular human presence, which can be summarized as follows: A) Pharaonic Period (?); b) Ptolemaic Period (?); c) Late Roman Period; d) First Christian phase: End of the 5th/6th century; e) Second Christian phase corresponding to the first phase of the Islamic Period: 8th century; f) Second Islamic phase: 19th century (Mahmud II) (Pirelli 2015).

305.html,Textual layers in Coffin Texts spells 154-160,"Coffin Texts spells 154-160 do not only constitute a unified composition because they describe the bas of different localities but also because they give a chronologically organized account of the events that happen during the course of a lunar month, from one period of invisibility to the next one. Within the composition, which may be dubbed the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Moon, different units can be discerned through the analysis of the content of the texts. Thus spells 154, 157, and 158 clearly form a subsection that is bound together by the predominance of the sun god Re and the recurring aetiological motif. This grouping also implies that Coffin Texts spells 155 and 156, in which the emphasis is on Thoth, and Re is barely mentioned, were inserted into a previously existing text. The core text consisting of spells 154, 157, and 158 was also enlarged by the addition of two more spells at the end (spells 159 and 160) that likewise lack explanatory comments on how things came to exist. The identification of the different textual layers leads to the conjecture that a significant part of the composition (the three core spells and the last two spells) may have belonged to the corpus of mortuary texts compiled prior to the Middle Kingdom in the Memphite area and then were later augmented in Hermopolis, the chief cult centre of the preeminent lunar god, Thoth. The composition as a whole gives us a unique chance to get a better understanding of how the collection of spells known as the Coffin Texts was developed and what role Hermopolis played in the process. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

306.html,Worship and places of worship in the Greco-Roman town at Marina El-Alamein,"The ancient town discovered at the place of today's Marina El-Alamein developed from the 2nd century BC to the 6th century AD. Situated on the northern coast of Egypt, it found itself at the crossroads of several cultures. The syncretism prevailing there is particularly notable in religion and worship. No relics of a temple have been discovered so far in situ, yet its location east of the main square of the town can be determined on the basis of neighbouring buildings. A quadrangular public building situated in the south-western part of the central square can also be identified as dedicated to worship. Among the objects of private worship, aediculae from the houses' main rooms occupy a special position. A discovery of a painting from a niche, with images of Serapis, Harpocrates and Helios, confirmed the cult character of the aediculae. Simple, small niches are also found in the houses: Some were decidedly lararia, others may have served utilitarian purposes. In the area of the houses, figurines of deities of Greek and mainly Egyptian origin were found. In the houses small altars were discovered, marking sacred spaces. Private worship is also a reflection of the state cult. Its most interesting architectural testimony is a commemorative monument to Commodus. Based on objects and places of worship, it is possible to interpret the religious life of the residents and associated rituals: One of these was the mummification of corpses. Encountered in the necropolis are images of Egyptian gods: Horus and Anubis. Altars located in front of ground structures of hypogea and in their underground courtyards served the worship of the dead. The layout of the hypogeum, with an underground courtyard and a dromos leading to it, clearly refers to Egyptian sepulchral architecture. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

310.html,Elements of continuity: Stone Cult in the Maltese Islands,"Stones can serve an infinite array of functions both when they are worked and when they are left in a ‘raw’ state. Depending on their function, stones can also be meaningful objects especially when they act as vehicles of ideas or instruments of representation. And it is, therefore, in their functional context, that the meaning of stones can be best grasped. The stones dealt with in this study are non-figural (or aniconic) or, sometimes, semi-figural. They come from ritual contexts and, as such, act as a material representation of divine presence in their role as betyls. But it is not mainly the representational aspect of these stones that this study seeks to highlight. As material representations of divine presence that are also worshipped, these particular stones form part of a phenomenon that seems to know no geographical or temporal boundaries. They are of a universal character. It is this universal character of theirs that seems to qualify these stones as elements forming part of the phenomenon of continuity: continuity across different cultures and in different places along several centuries. It is this phenomenon which this study seeks to highlight through a study of these stones. The Maltese islands are presented as a case study to demonstrate the phenomenon of continuity through a study of these stones. Worship of stones in representation of divine presence is found on the Maltese islands since prehistoric times. But the practice survived several centuries under different cultures represented by unknown communities during the islands’ prehistory and the Phoenicians / Carthaginians and the Romans in early historic times. © Archaeopress and George Azzopardi 2017.",Azzopardi George,-,-,-
311.html,"New home, new herds: Cuman integration and animal husbandry in medieval hungary from an archaeozoological perspective","The Cumans, a people that inhabited the steppe zone in the medieval period and actively shaped the fate of the region from the Black Sea to the Carpathian Basin, have been primarily known to history as nomadic, mounted warriors. Some of them arrived in the Hungarian Kingdom in the midthirteenth century as a group of refugees fleeing the invading Mongol army and asked for asylum. In the course of three centuries they settled down in the kingdom, converted to Christianity, and were integrated into medieval Hungarian society. This study collects all available information, historical, ethnographic and archaeological alike, on the animal husbandry aspect of the complex development of the Cuman population in medieval Hungary. Although this medieval minority has been in the focus of scholarly interest in the past decades, no attempt has been made so far to study their herds using interdisciplinary methods. The research of faunal assemblages through archaeozoological methods has the potential to reveal direct, and by other means, unavailable information on animal keeping practices, although this source of evidence often escapes scholarly attention in Central and Eastern Europe. This book combines a primary scientific dataset with historical information and interprets them within the framework of settlement history in order to investigate the manifold integration process of a medieval community. © Archaeopress, Archaeolingua and Kyra Lyublyanovics 2017.",Lyublyanovics Kyra,-,-,-

313.html,"Building B, a domestic construction at Tell el-Ghaba, North Sinai","Tell el-Ghaba is an archaeological site of the Third Intermediate/Early Saite period located in the former eastern end of the Delta, connected to the now defunct Pelusiac Branch. Building B was a domestic mud brick construction of 13 x 9m, comprising six rooms and a small magazine or storage room. The entrance was probably oriented towards the badly preserved southeast corner, where a mud brick yard or porch seems to have been built. The presence of a hearth intercalated among the mud bricks of the western external wall, the different composition and size of the upper mud bricks and the renewed floors are clear indications that Building B was refurbished. Two ovens, each with an auxiliary platform, were recovered: One of them was bonded to the walls and the other was just attached. In order to recreate the household activities that may have taken place in each room, and the function that Building B may have played in the context of the site, we will only consider the material found on the floors. Food preparation, cooking, consumption and storage activities seem to have been important, as indicated by the presence of the aforementioned magazine and the two ovens. The latter suggest that Building B may have been the residence of an extended family that lived there, perhaps for several generations, as denoted by the refurbishment of the building. High economic status can be inferred from the presence of a gold bead, a few Upper Egyptian vessels and small fine Cypriote Black-on-Red ridge-neck juglets. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

314.html,"The Campus Wells Program: Preserving and re-tasking: Monitoring wells in Boston, MA from campus construction for environmental educational purposes","I used existing groundwater monitoring wells in the Back Bay area of Boston, MA as an effective way to teach the applied aspects of integrating the natural world with the built environment. These wells were installed as part of engineering studies for construction and rehabilitation of campus buildings, and through their use in laboratory exercises, undergraduate students developed valuable, field-based insight into the physical meaning of environmental science, mathematical models of groundwater movement, and the practical knowledge of professional practice. I arranged ongoing permission to access these wells and prevent them from being plugged once construction was completed. I compiled the existing long-term well data from both the Northeastern University Physical Plant office and the geotechnical engineering firm who installed the wells, providing students with context for their field measurements in lab. This project gave undergraduate students in introductory and upper division environmental science courses an opportunity to learn about water quality issues, construction and excavation issues, architectural retrofitting, and historical water table changes through analysis of the data. Close proximity of the wells to the classroom made possible many independent student projects. Through the Campus Wells Program, I involved the working community - including the Physical Plant staff at multiple colleges, and professional geologists in the geotechnical engineering consulting firm - in the learning process. Students recognized that their class laboratory exercises contributed real data to a long-term study of the hydrogeology of the campus, giving students buy-in to the project.

The machinery was bound for the world's largest deposits of tar or oil sands, a heavy crude oil substance called bitumen, located in the western Canadian province of Alberta. These loads of machinery, what became known as megaloads, encountered much resistance. Throughout Idaho and the surrounding region, a network organized opposition. Neighbors, grassroots organizations, nonprofits, and the Nez Perce and other tribes all collaborated. They held information sessions, protested, waged legal battles, monitored the loads, and blockaded highways. What oil companies hoped would be a cost-effective solution for transporting their megaloads became a David versus Goliath, Coyote versus the Monster-to reference the Nez Perce creation story-struggle to protect rural and indigenous ways of life and sovereignty, and the planet. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Grosse Corrie,Department of Sociology\University of California Santa Barbara\United States,-,-

While communities once farmed, cared for, and sustained a spiritual land ethic toward ahupua'a holistically from mauka (mountainside) to makai (seaside), today many are no longer the clean and productive watersheds they once were as these traditional practices have fallen away. In He'eia, an ahupua'a on the island of O'ahu, several nonprofit organizations are working to revitalize a cohesive ahupua'a management system that can serve as a model for other ahupua'a in Hawai'i and around the Pacific, as well as serve as an example of holistic management practices in the twenty-first century. In the uplands, one organization works to restore the ahupua'a's stream by removing invasive plant species and replanting native flora. In the kula lands (flatlands), another group works to restore the wetland that filters inflow into the bay by planting kalo (taro) and revitalizing traditional Hawaiian polyculture. At the seashore, a third nonprofit is working to restore an 800-year-old fishpond with the intent to promote food security while conducting research on Hawaiian history and water quality. All three groups run extensive educational programs for locals and visitors of all ages and work to keep pollutants out of the watershed and stream as it flows downhill and out onto the reef. By weaving modern technologies, tools, and information together with stories, songs, and attitudes that embody deep and ancient ties between mankind and land, this creative and cooperative management is returning food security, sustainable culture, and resilience to the hands of the community. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Campbell Holly V.,Oregon State University\OR\United States; Catalina Island Marine Institute\CA\United States,-,-
322.html,Using the “3ES” method to evaluate REDD+ project in Nepal,"This case demonstrates the utility of the 3Es (effectiveness, efficiency, and equity) in examining Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) project in Nepal. REDD+ offers results-based payments for conserving and managing forests sustainably and enhancing forest carbon stocks. This will benefit communities' efforts to conserve forest resources and prevent deforestation; conserving integrity of forests in turn benefits the global carbon budget. This case uses the 3Es to examine one case in Nepal of distributing the REDD+ funds among local participants. Of the 3Es, equity is getting attention worldwide but there is still debate on which principle of 3Es should be given priority to achieve overall effectiveness of REDD+. This case finds that equity is a fundamental requirement to achieve the other Es (efficiency and effectiveness) in REDD+ implementation. Further, I find that distributive equity is the most important and understood in three different ways in Nepal: rights, needs, and performance. There is an argument between communities and experts on which equity should be given priority. I recommend that the issue of needs based equity vs. performance-based equity should be solved by formation of guidelines of sharing benefits at two levels. First, the benefit distribution from international sources/markets to community forest user groups should be based on the ownership of carbon and performance of communities participating in REDD+. Second, at community level, communities should decide on the form of benefit distribution according to their needs. The primacy of equity in this case will likely find international echoes in other environmental policies and in other countries. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Sherpa Doma Tshering,Lincoln University\Lincoln\New Zealand,-,-
323.html,Institutionalizing coastal restoration in Louisiana after Hurricanes katrina and Rita: The Importance of Advocacy Coalitions and Claims-Making in Post-disaster Policy Innovation,"Why do disasters sometimes lead to the creation of innovative, new policy frameworks? People often assume that this happens because disasters cause people to understand environmental problems in new ways. However, this case study of changes in Louisiana's coastal land management policy after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 tells a different story. After the hurricanes, state and federal legislators passed several laws that created a framework for comprehensive coastal restoration, replacing the haphazard and poorly funded approach that preceded the storms. This policy innovation occurred because the hurricanes created an opportunity to enact ideas developed by a coalition of coastal scientists, environmental attorneys, and local businesspeople during the previous three decades. Without the long-term work of this advocacy coalition, policy innovation would probably not have occurred. The case study presents the history of coastal restoration policy in Louisiana and explains how this history illustrates models of policy agenda setting from political science and environmental problems construction from sociology. In turn, these models provide a key to interpreting other examples of post-disaster policy change. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Haedicke Michael A.,Drake University\2507 University Avenue\United States,-,-
324.html,Finding fault with the Nexus pipeline? Agency capture and the public good,"Natural gas is an increasingly vital U.S. energy source that is presently being tapped and transported across state and international boundaries. Controversy engulfs natural gas, from the hydraulic fracturing process used to liberate it from massive, gas-laden Appalachian shale deposits, to the permitting and construction of new interstate pipelines bringing it to markets. This case explores the controversy flowing from the proposed 256-mile-long interstate Nexus pipeline transecting northern Ohio, southeastern Michigan and terminating at the Dawn Hub in Ontario, Canada. As the lead agency regulating and permitting interstate pipelines, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is also tasked with mitigating environmental risks through the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act's Environmental Impact Statement process. Pipeline opponents assert that a captured federal agency ignores public and scientific input, inadequately addresses public health and safety risks, preempts local control, and wields eminent domain powers at the expense of landowners, cities, and everyone in the pipeline path. Proponents counter that pipelines are the safest means of transporting domestically abundant, cleaner burning, affordable gas to markets that will boost local and regional economies and serve the public good. Debates over what constitutes the public good are only one set in a long list of contentious issues including pipeline safety, proposed routes, property rights, public voice, and questions over the scientific and democratic validity of the Environmental Impact Statement process. The Nexus pipeline provides a sobering example that simple energy policy solutions and compromise are elusive-effectively fueling greater conflict as the natural gas industry booms. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Kear Andrew R.,Department of Environment and Sustainability\School of Earth\United States,-,-

In this phytotron study, inorganic phosphorus (Pi) accumulation by periphyton was investigated for varying inputs of calcium [Ca(II)] or ferrous‑iron [Fe(II)], and lighting conditions. Results indicated that additions of Ca(II) or Fe(II) enhanced abiotic accumulation of Piby up to 16 times, and decreased solution Piconcentration by up to 50%, especially under light condition. The enhanced Piaccumulation into periphyton intensified with increasing Piconcentration, and Piaccumulation showed a positive linear relationship with Ca or Fe accumulation. Abiotic accumulation of Piinduced by Ca(II) was mainly through Ca-phosphate precipitation, and co-precipitation of P with carbonates at pH > 8. Accumulation with added Fe(II) was mainly considered to be through Fe(III) phosphate precipitation coupled with adsorption of Piby ferric hydroxides. Moreover, Fe(II) was more effective than Ca(II) in promoting abiotic accumulation of Piby periphyton. Our results indicate the potential for controlling environmental factors to enhance the role of periphyton in biogeochemical cycling and P-use efficiency in paddy rice fields and to reduce P discharged to neighboring water bodies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Jiu-yu; Deng Kai-ying; Hesterberg Dean; Xia Yong-qiu; Wu Chen-xi; Xu Ren-kou,State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture\Institute of Soil Science\China; Department of Crop and Soil Sciences\North Carolina State University\United States; State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology\Institute of Hydrobiology\China,-,Ca(II); Calcite; Fe(II); Ferric hydroxide; Periphyton; Phosphate precipitation

328.html,"The potential ecotoxicological impact of pharmaceutical and personal care products on humans and freshwater, based on USEtox™ characterization factors. A Spanish case study of toxicity impact scores","Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are being increasingly included in Life Cycle Assessment studies (LCAs) since they have brought into evidence both human and ecological adverse effects due to their presence in different environmental compartments, wastewater facilities and industry. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to estimate the characterization factors (CFs) of 27 PPCPs widely used worldwide in order to incorporate their values into Life Cycle Impact Assessment studies (LCIA) or to generate a toxicity impact score ranking. Physicochemical properties, degradation rates, bioaccumulation, ecotoxicity and human health effects were collected from experimental data, recognized databases or estimated using EPI Suite™ and the USEtox™ software, and were subsequently used for estimating CFs. In addition, a Spanish toxicity impact score ranking was carried out for 49 PPCPs using the 27 newly calculated CFs, and 22 CFs already available in the literature, besides the data related to the occurrence of PPCPs in the environment in Spain. It has been highlighted that emissions into the continental freshwater compartment showed the highest CFs values for human effects (ranging from 10− 9to 10− 3Cases·kg− 1), followed by emissions into the air (10− 9to 10− 5Cases·kg− 1), soil (10− 11to 105Cases·kg− 1) and seawater (10− 12to 10− 4Cases·kg− 1). CFs regarding the affectation of freshwater aquatic environments were the highest of those proceeding from emissions into continental freshwater (between 1 to 104PAF·m3·day·kgemission− 1) due to the direct contact between the source of emission and the compartment affected, followed by soil (among 10− 1to 104PAF·m3·day·kgemission− 1), and air (among 10− 2to 104PAF·m3·day·kgemission− 1) while the lowest were the CFs of continental seawater (among 10− 28to 10− 3PAF·m3·day·kgemission− 1). Freshwater aquatic ecotoxicological CFs are much higher than human toxicity CFs, demonstrating that the ecological impact of PPCPs in aquatic environments must be a matter of urgent attention. According to the Spanish toxicity impact score calculated, the PPCPs with the highest impact are hormones, antidepressants, fragrances, antibiotics, angiotensin receptor blockers and blood lipid regulators, which have already been found in other kinds of score rankings. These results, which were not available until now, will be useful in order to perform better LCIA studies, incorporating the micro-pollutants whose CFs have been estimated, or in order to carry out single hazard/risk environmental impact assessments. © 2017",Ortiz de García Sheyla; García-Encina Pedro A.; Irusta-Mata Rubén,Department of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology\University of Valladolid\Spain; Department of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology\University of Valladolid\Spain; Department of Chemistry\Faculty of Sciences and Technology\Venezuela,-,Characterization factor; Ecotoxicity; Human toxicity; Life cycle impact assessment; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products
329.html,Assessing water scarcity in agricultural production system based on the generalized water resources and water footprint framework,"An indicator, agricultural water stress index (AWSI), was established based blue-green water resources and water footprint framework for regional water scarcity in agricultural production industry evaluation. AWSI is defined as the ratio of the total agricultural water footprint (AWF) to water resources availability (AWR) in a single year. Then, the temporal and spatial patterns of AWSI in China during 1999–2014 were analyzed based on the provincial AWR and AWF quantification. The results show that the annual AWR in China has been maintained at approximately 2540 Gm3, of which blue water accounted for > 70%. The national annual AWF was approximately 1040 Gm3during the study period and comprised 65.6% green, 12.7% blue and 21.7% grey WFs The space difference in both the AWF for per unit arable land (AWFI) and its composition was significant. National AWSI was calculated as 0.413 and showed an increasing trend in the observed period. This index increased from 0.320 (mid-water stress level) in 2000 to 0.490 (high water stress level) in the present due to the expansion of the agricultural production scale. The Northern provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (PAMs) have been facing high water stress, particularly the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, which was at a very high water stress level (AWSI > 0.800). Humid South China faces increasingly severe water scarcity, and most of the PAMs in the region have converted from low water stress level (AWSI = 0.100–0.200) to mid water stress level (AWSI = 0.200–0.400). The AWSI is more appropriate for reflecting the regional water scarcity than the existing water stress index (WSI) or the blue water scarcity (BWS) indicator, particularly for the arid agricultural production regions due to the revealed environmental impacts of agricultural production.

He spent his entire life recording, dating and redefining the methods of understanding Late Egyptian sculpture, an effort that culminated in the creation of the Corpus of Late Egyptian Sculpture, a collection of detailed notes, high quality photographs and negatives currently held at the Brooklyn Museum. In 2008 the Università degli Studi di Milano purchased Bothmer's private archives, a collection of notes for his classes and lectures, papers delivered at conferences and seminars, detailed dossiers on museums and Egyptian collections around the world, drawings and about 10,000 photographs. During the doctoral research I am currently conducting at the Scuola Normale Superiore, which focuses on a comprehensive study of Ptolemaic private portraiture, I had the chance to look at Bothmer's private archives in Milan. Among the documents, I have identified two unpublished papers focusing on one of Bernard V. Bothmer's main topics of interest throughout his scholarly career: The depiction of the individual in Egyptian art. Through the study of the unpublished papers in his private archives which focus on realism and Ptolemaic portraiture it is possible to detect the development of the scholar's thought on Ptolemaic sculptures characterized by realistic facial features. The aim of the present paper is to outline, with the aid of both published and unpublished documents, the development of Bothmer's thought on one of the main issues of Ptolemaic art, namely Ptolemaic portraiture. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The effects of monomer concentration, MHCS-to-AM ratio, illumination time, initiator concentration, pH on viscosity, and grafting efficiency were investigated to optimize the synthesis of these substances. MHCS-g-PAM was characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Flocculation mechanisms in alga-containing wastewater at various pH levels and dosages were examined in detail on the basis of zeta potential measurements. Zeta potential experiments indicated that the adsorption-bridging and charge neutralization mechanisms played an important role in algal removal. Flocculation tests on algal removal demonstrated that the flocculation performance of MHCS-g-PAM was more effective than that of cationic polyacrylamide, polyferric sulfate, and polymeric aluminium. The optimal Chl-a and COD removal rate obtained by MHCS-g-PAM was 98.6% and 94.9% at pH 7 and 4 mg·L− 1, respectively. © 2017",Lu Xi; Xu Yanhua; Sun Wenquan; Sun Yongjun; Zheng Huaili,Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Industrial Water-Conservation & Emission Reduction\College of Environment\China; College of Urban Construction\Nanjing Tech University\China; Key Laboratory of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's Eco-Environment\State Ministry of Education\China,-,Acylation modification; Algal removal; Chitosan; Grafting; Photopolymerization

Previous research has focused on the efficiency of remediation at contaminated sites (where identified), as well as improvement of preservation techniques and workplace health and safety. Few studies have assessed the human health risks from occupational exposure to OCPs in buildings of cultural and historical importance. Thus, potential risks may remain unidentified. In the present study, OCPs in indoor air were measured in a baroque theatre and a natural history museum in the Czech Republic, both of which had suspected past indoor application. In the theatre attic p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE) levels in air were up to 190 ng m− 3, confirming past indoor use of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT). There was also evidence of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) use in the theatre (max γ-HCH in air of 56 ng m− 3). Yet, the cancer risk (CR) from occupational exposure via inhalation (Expi) to OCPs in the theatre was low (CR < 4.0 × 10− 6). γ-HCH was found at elevated levels in air of the museum (max γ-HCH in air of 15,000 ng m− 3). CR from Expiin the museum was moderate to high (> 1 × 10− 4). Our results show the CR through Expito OCPs in buildings, such as museums can still be significant enough to warrant mitigation measures, e.g., remediation. © 2017",Holt Eva; Audy Ondřej; Booij Petra; Melymuk Lisa; Prokes Roman; Klánová Jana,Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment (RECETOX)\Kamenice 753/5\Czech Republic,-,Human health (cancer) risk; Inhalation exposure; Organochlorine pesticide; Remediation
332.html,The effects of weather on pediatric seizure: A single-center retrospective study (2005–2015),"Background Several studies have reported an association between seizure and the weather. However, reports are conflicting. Thus, we investigated whether emergency department visits due to seizure are affected by weather. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 108,628 emergency department visits to Samsung Changwon Hospital by pediatric patients from January 2005 to December 2015. Among them, there were 3484 (3.2%) visits for any type of seizure. Seizures were categorized as febrile seizure, afebrile seizure, epilepsy, or status epilepticus. We used a distributed lag non-linear model with quasi-Poisson distribution to investigate the association between weather and pediatric seizure. Results During this 11-year study period, over the half of total pediatric seizure patients were febrile seizure (53.5%) and the proportion for status epilepticus were the lowest (5.9%). Mean of mean temperature and diurnal temperature range were 14.7 °C and 8.3 °C. Mean humidity was 62.1%, mean of atmospheric pressure was 1015.5 hPa and mean of sunshine was 6.3 Hr. When considering the overall 0–15 days lagged effect of weather, only mean temperature was significantly associated with emergency department visits. At lower temperatures, the number of emergency department visits increases and decreases at higher temperatures. All 4 types of seizure also showed similar patterns. In particular, only visits of febrile seizure were significantly associated with mean temperature. Conclusion We investigated the association weather and pediatric seizure by considering 0–15 day lags. In particular, low mean temperature increase the emergency department visits for pediatric seizure and high mean temperature decrease the pediatric seizure. In addition, only febrile seizure of 4 seizure types was affected by mean average temperature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kim Sung Hoon; Kim Joon Soo; Jin Mi Hyeon; Lee Jun Hwa,Department of Pediatrics\Samsung Changwon Hospital\South Korea; Department of Neurosurgery\Samsung Changwon Hospital\South Korea; Department of Biostatistics\Samsung Changwon Hospital\South Korea,-,Emergency department visits; Epilepsy; Febrile seizure; Pediatric; Weather factors
333.html,Improved source apportionment of PAHs and Pb by integrating Pb stable isotopes and positive matrix factorization application (PAHs): A historical record case study from the northern South China Sea,"To obtain the historical changes of pyrogenic sources, integrated source apportionment methods, which include PAH compositions, diagnostic ratios (DRs), Pb isotopic ratios, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, were developed and applied in sediments of the northern South China Sea. These methods provided a gradually clear picture of energy structural change. Spatially, Σ15PAH (11.3 to 95.5 ng/g) and Pb (10.2 to 74.6 μg/g) generally exhibited decreasing concentration gradient offshore; while the highest levels of PAHs and Pb were observed near the southern Taiwan Strait, which may be induced by accumulation of different fluvial input. Historical records of pollutants followed closely with the economic development of China, with fast growth of Σ15PAH and Pb occurring since the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. The phasing-out of leaded gasoline in China was captured with a sharp decrease of Pb after the mid-1990s. PAHs and Pb correlated well with TOC and clay content for core sediments, which was not observed for surface sediments. There was an up-core increase of high molecular PAH proportions. Coal and biomass burning were then qualitatively identified as the major sources of PAHs with DRs. Furthermore, shift toward less radiogenic signatures of Pb isotopic ratios after 1900 revealed the start and growing importance of industrial sources. Finally, a greater separation and quantification of various input was achieved by a three-factor PMF model, which made it clear that biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions accounted for 40 ± 20%, 41 ± 13%, and 19 ± 12% of PAHs through the core. Biomass and coal combustion acted as major sources before 2000, while contributions from vehicle emission soared thereafter. The integrated multi-methodologies here improved the source apportionment by reducing biases with a step-down and cross-validation perspective, which could be similarly applied to other aquatic systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cai Minggang; Lin Yan; Chen Meng; Yang Weifeng; Du Huihong; Xu Ye; Cheng Shayen; Xu Fangjian; Hong Jiajun; Chen Mian; Ke Hongwei,State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science\Xiamen University\China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory for Coastal Ecology and Environmental Studies\Xiamen University\China; College of Ocean and Earth Sciences\Xiamen University\China; College of the Environment and Ecology\Xiamen University\China,-,Energy structure; Lead (Pb); Northern South China Sea; Pb isotopic ratios; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Positive matrix factorization (PMF)
334.html,Children's environmental health based on birth cohort studies of Asia,"Numerous studies have explored the associations between environmental pollutants and pediatric health. Recent studies have investigated the issue in Asia, but no systematic review has been published to date. This study aims to elucidate the issue by summarizing relevant epidemiologic evidence for cohorts in Asia, using information from the Birth Cohort Consortium of Asia (BiCCA). Environmental pollutants include mercury, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and phthalates. This study sought to classify the effects of such compounds on fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, allergic disease and immune function and the endocrine system and puberty. These evidences showed ETS has been associated with infant birth weight, children's neurodevelopment and allergy disease; mercury and PCB have been shown to affect children's neurodevelopment; phthalate has effects on endocrine function; PFAS alters children's neurodevelopment, the endocrine system, and the allergic response. However, more consistent and coordinated research is necessary to understand the whole picture of single environmental and/or co-exposure and children's health. Therefore, harmonization and international collaboration are also needed in Asia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tsai Meng-Shan; Chen Mei-Huei; Lin Ching-Chun; Ng Sharon; Hsieh Chia-Jung; Liu Chen-yu; Hsieh Wu-Shiun; Chen Pau-Chung,Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene\National Taiwan University College of Public Health\Taiwan; Institute of Population Health Sciences\National Health Research Institutes\Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics\National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine\Taiwan; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology\Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine\Singapore,-,Asia; Birth cohort; Environmental tobacco smoke; Mercury; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Phthalates; Polychlorinated biphenyls

The DOC concentrations ranged from 15 to 4992 μmol C L− 1, with an overall volume weighted mean (VWM) of 288 ± 17 μmol C L− 1(n = 881). The number of fire spots accumulated within each year of this study was positively correlated to the VWM concentration of DOC in rainwater. During the whole study period, higher VWM DOC concentrations were found during the dry months, despite the phasing out of agricultural fires in sugar cane plantations. The evidence suggested that inputs of atmospheric soluble organic carbon from biomass burning exceeded those from vehicular fuel combustion and biogenic sources. In most cases, dilution of DOC according to precipitation volume was minimal, showing that in-cloud processes were dominant for this species. In contrast, most of the volatile dissolved organic carbon (VDOC) appeared to be removed from the atmosphere in the first milliliter or so of rain, showing a dominance of below-cloud scavenging. VDOC contributed a significant fraction of the DOC for 62% of the samples analyzed, ranging from 5.1 to 488 μmol C L− 1(n = 552). The average wet deposition flux of DOC was 49 kg C ha− 1yr− 1, with VDOC accounting for 10% of the total. This dissolved carbon flux is higher than the estimated world average (34 kg C ha− 1yr− 1). The DOC in the rainwater was mostly labile (75% on average) and rapidly bioavailable (within days to weeks), in contrast to refractory dissolved carbon found in rainwater from regions where fossil fuel combustion is the dominant source. The findings of this work indicate that biomass burning can lead to important atmospheric inputs of readily available organic matter to land and to the open ocean. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Godoy-Silva Daniely; Nogueira Raquel F.P.; Campos M.

337.html,A novel surface imprinted polymer/magnetic hydroxyapatite nanocomposite for selective dibenzothiophene scavenging,"Highly selective adsorbent for dibenzothiophene (DBT) was successfully designed and prepared. Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and magnetic hydroxyapatite (MHAP) were used as building blocks for the novel nanocomposite adsorbent. MIP/MHAP was synthesized by grafting polymerization and surface molecular imprinting using DBT as a template molecule. The microstructure and morphology of the designed nanoadsorbent were examined via FTIR, SEM and VSM. Specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by Quantachrome Nova 3200S automated gas sorption apparatus. Additionally, static adsorption experiments, isotherms and selective recognition adsorption studies were carried out. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to determine DBT. The experimental data exhibits excellent adsorption capacity for DBT reaches 247 mg/g within 60 min. Competitive adsorption results proved that MIP/MHAP have a greater affinity towards DBT molecules than benzothiophene analogues. Pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm were used to describe the adsorption process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ali Hager R.; El-Maghrabi Heba H.; Zahran Fouad; Moustafa Yasser Mohamed,Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute\11727\Egypt; Faculty of Science\Helwan University\Egypt; Helwan Nanotechnology Center\Helwan University\Egypt,-,Adsorption; Desulfurization; Dibenzothiophene; Magnetic hydroxyapatite; Nanocomposite; Surface imprinted polymer

The results reveal that the addition of Nd increases the corrosion resistance of Zn-5Al alloy, which can be ascribed to the modification of the microstructure and the corrosion products, the improvement of the integrity of Al2O3film and the inhibition of the selective corrosion of η-Zn and α-Al phases. The corrosion mechanism of Zn-Al eutectic structure is also discussed.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cao Zujun; Kong Gang; Che Chunshan; Wang Yanqi,School of Materials Science and Engineering\South China University of Technology\China,-,Alloy; EIS; Rare earth elements; SEM; Zinc
339.html,Modifying surface properties of KIT-6 zeolite with Ni and V for enhancing catalytic CO methanation,"The surface of the KIT-6 zeolite was modified with different amounts of Ni and V to promote the catalytic properties for CO methanation. A series of xNi-yV/KIT-6 with various Ni and V contents were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. The modified surfaces were characterized using N2adsorption-desorption, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. The characterization results illustrated that the modification of V species was able to significantly promote low-temperature catalytic performance below 350 °C compared to that of unmodified Ni/KIT-6, which was likely due to an increase in the H2uptake accompanied by enhanced CO dissociation derived from stronger electron transfer from V species to Ni0. Correspondingly, the xNi-yV/KIT-6 catalysts exhibited a distinct enhancement in CO conversion, CH4selectivity and CH4yield over unmodified Ni/KIT-6. Among all catalysts, 20Ni-2V/KIT-6 showed the best catalytic performance, corresponding to nearly 100% CO conversion and 85% CH4yield at a low temperature of 300 °C. Furthermore, 20Ni-2V/KIT-6 presented enhanced coking-resistant and anti-sintering properties during a 60h-lifetime test at 500 °C and 1 atm with a high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 60000 ml/g/h.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cao Hong-Xia; Zhang Jun; Guo Cheng-Long; Chen Jingguang G.; Ren Xiang-Kun,Low Carbon Energy Institute\China University of Mining and Technology\China; Earth and Environmental Engineering Department\Columbia University\United States; School of Electrical and Power Engineering\China University of Mining and Technology\China; Department of Chemical Engineering\Columbia University\United States,-,CO methanation; KIT-6 zeolite; Ni and V modifier; Surface modification
34.html,The ang-morphs in Coptic and their grammaticalization in Later Egyptian,"This study explores the possibility that the so-called ang- morphs, i.e., the phonologically reduced forms of independent personal pronouns in Coptic, are copulas. The literature states that Coptic has copulas that are derived from demonstrative pronouns, but there is no argument that the ang- morphs are copulas. However, these reduced forms are only used in nominal sentences, and they show a strong paradigmatic parallelism with the pe copulas. In order to indicate this, first, I typologized the grammaticalization patterns of copulas of diverse languages across the world, with reference to the literature on linguistic typology. I determined that there are three types of grammaticalization of copulas: (1) from an existential verb, (2) from a demonstrative pronoun, and (3) from a personal pronoun. Various languages have Type 3 copulas. Specifically, Classical Syriac has the phonologically reduced forms of the independent personal pronouns as copulas. Their phonological reduction and semantic breaching are similar to the ang- morphs in Sahidic. From this typological point of view, the ang- morphs have the potential to be seen as copulas. Next, I conducted a corpus research on the digitized version of the Sahidic New Testament. The results show that anok ang-NP sentences occur with indefinite NPs, and that the anok pe NP sentences tend to occur with definite NPs. Thus, we can see the paradigmatic relationship of the ang- morphs and the pe copulas in these copulative sentences. Finally, I explored the degree of grammaticalization of the ang- morphs. The dialectal and historical research suggests that Sahidic and Mesokemic have the most reduced forms of the ang- morphs, and the equivalents to the Coptic anok ang-NP sentences in Demotic and Late Egyptian are rare. These factors suggest a high possibility that the grammaticalization of the ang- morphs as copulas from independent personal pronouns in Later Egyptian were most developed in Sahidic and Mesokemic. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

In general, silica exists in three different morphologies when constructing superhydrophobic materials, they are silica particles, silica micro-string networks, and silica gels. Based on this, we give out a panoramic presentation about the synthesis, fabrications, and properties of these “different kinds of silica”. Besides, some of recent applications, such as anti-reflection, oil-water separation, environmental applications, etc, are briefly introduced.

However, it is difficult to select the proper doping acid, which improves the corrosion resistance of the coating without affecting its conductivity. In this study, large spatial molecular group camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) doped polypyrrole (PPY) conductive coating was prepared by galvanostatic electropolymerization on 304SS. The electrochemical properties of the coating were evaluated in 0.1 M H2SO4solution in order to simulate the PEMFC service environment. The results indicate that the coating increased the corrosion potential and shifted Ecorrtowards more positive value, particularly the jcorrvalue of PPY-CSA coated 304SS was dropped from 97.3 to 0.00187 μA cm−2. The long-term immersion tests (660 h) show that the PPY-CSA coating exhibits better corrosion resistance in comparison with the small acid (SO42−) doped PPY-SO42−or PPY/PPY-SO42−coatings. Moreover, the PPY-CSA coating presents low contact resistance and maintains strong corrosion resistance during the prolonged exposure time due to barrier effect and anodic protection.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Jiang Li; Syed Junaid Ali; Gao Yangzhi; Zhang Qiuxiang; Zhao Junfeng; Lu Hongbin; Meng Xiangkang,Institute of Materials Engineering\National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures\China,-,Anti-corrosive; Bipolar plates; Camphorsulfonic acid; Conductivity; Polypyrrole
343.html,"Rapid adsorption of Pb, Cu and Cd from aqueous solutions by β-cyclodextrin polymers","Removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions has drawn more and more attentions these years because of their serious global health challenge to human society. To develop an adsorbent with low-cost and high-efficiency for removal of heavy metals (HMs), β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) polymers crosslinked with rigid aromatic groups were prepared and used for lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) removal for the first time. The negatively charged β-CD polymers with large BET surface area were suitable to be used in HMs adsorption. The adsorption process completed in 5 min was well fit by Freundlich isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model. The intraparticle diffusion model was also appropriate to describe the adsorption of Pb, Cu and Cd on β-CD polymer. The maximum of adsorption capacities at 25 °C for Pb, Cu and Cd were 196.42, 164.43 and 136.43 mg/g when the initial concentration was 200 mg/L. The HMs adsorption process on the surface of β-CD polymer was an endothermic and spontaneous process. Both of the electrostatic interaction and distribution of Pb, Cu and Cd species influenced the adsorption process at different pH values. The order of removal efficiencies in multi-component adsorption for the three metal ions were Pb > Cu > Cd. The adsorption mechanisms were H+ions on hydroxyl groups exchanged with heavy metal ions and electrostatic interactions. This study indicated that β-CD polymers could be developed into effective adsorbents for rapid removal of heavy metals.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",He Junyong; Li Yulian; Wang Chengming; Zhang Kaisheng; Lin Dongyue; Kong Lingtao; Liu Jinhuai,Nano-Materials and Environmental Detection Laboratory\Institute of Intelligent Machines\China; Department of Chemistry\University of Science and Technology of China\China; Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale\University of Science and Technology of China\China,-,Adsorption; Heavy metals; Mechanism; pH effects; β-CD polymer
344.html,"Improving assessment accuracy for lake biological condition by classifying lakes with diatom typology, varying metrics and modeling multimetric indices","Site grouping by regions or typologies, site-specific modeling and varying metrics among site groups are four approaches that account for natural variation, which can be a major source of error in ecological assessments. Using a data set from the 2007 National Lakes Assessment project of the USEPA, we compared performances of multimetric indices (MMI) of biological condition that were developed: (1) with different lake grouping methods, ecoregions or diatom typologies; (2) by varying or not varying metrics among site groups; and (3) with different statistical techniques for modeling diatom metric values expected for minimally disturbed condition for each lake. Hierarchical modeling of MMIs, i.e. grouping sites by ecoregions or typologies and then modeling natural variability in metrics among lakes within groups, substantially improved MMI performance compared to using either ecoregions or site-specific modeling alone. Compared with MMIs based on ecoregion site groups, MMI precision and sensitivity to human disturbance were better when sites were grouped by diatom typologies and assessing performance nationwide. However, when MMI performance was evaluated at site group levels, as some government agencies often do, there was little difference in MMI performance between the two site grouping methods. Low numbers of reference and highly impacted sites in some typology groups likely limited MMI performance at the group level of analysis. Varying metrics among site groups did not improve MMI performance. Random forest models for site-specific expected metric values performed better than classification and regression tree and multiple linear regression, except when numbers of reference sites were small in site groups. Then classification and regression tree models were most precise. Based on our results, we recommend hierarchical modeling in future large scale lake assessments where lakes are grouped by ecoregions or diatom typologies and site-specific metric models are used to establish expected metric values. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Bo; Stevenson R.

345.html,"Interaction of 3′,4′,6′-trimyristoyl-uridine derivative as potential anticancer drug with phospholipids of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells","Investigating the mechanism of action of drugs whose pharmaceutical activity is associated with cell membranes is fundamental to comprehending the biochemical and biophysical processes that occur on membrane surfaces. In this work, we investigated the interaction of an ester-type derivative of uridine, 3′,4′,6′-trimyristoyl uridine, with models for cell membranes formed by lipid monolayers at the air-water interface. For that, selected lipids have been chosen in order to mimic tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells. For mixed monolayers with 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DPPS), the surface pressure–area isotherms exhibited a noticeable shift to lower areas in relation to the areas predicted for ideal mixtures, indicating a condensation of the monolayer structure. Changes in the viscoelastic properties of the interfacial film could be inferred by analyzing the compressibility modulus of the monolayer. Structural and morphological changes were also evidenced by using vibrational spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy, respectively, with distinctive effects on DPPC and DPPS. As conclusion we can state that the lipid composition of the monolayer modulates the interaction with this lipophilic drug, which may have important implications in understanding how this drug acts on specific sites of the cellular membrane. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Salis Luiz Fernando Grosso; Jaroque Guilherme Nuñez; Escobar Jhon Fernando Berrío; Giordani Cristiano; Martinez Alejandro Martinez; Fernández Diana Margarita Márquez; Castelli Francesco; Sarpietro Maria Grazia; Caseli Luciano,Department of Chemistry\Federal University of Sao Paulo\Brazil; Productos Naturales Marinos\Departamento de Farmacia\Colombia; Instituto de Fisica\Universidad de Antioquia\Colombia; Dipartimento di Scienze del Farmaco\Università degli Studi di Catania\Italy,-,Air-water interface; Anticancer drugs; Langmuir monolayers; Uridine derivative

347.html,Enhanced electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4by constructing a stable Mn2+-rich interface,"Spinel LiMn2O4has drawn continuous attentions due to its low cost, good electrochemical performance, environmental friendliness and natural abundant resources. In view of its severe capacity fading, some types of manganese-based compounds with different Mn oxidation states are selected to protect bare LiMn2O4by constructing a stable coating layer. In this work, LiMn2O4@LiMnPO4composite, spherical LiMn2O4(LMO) as core and Mn2+-rich phase of LiMnPO4(LMP) as shell, is designed and synthesized. Two composites of LiMn2O4particles coated with 3 wt% and 10 wt% LiMnPO4have been compared studied. After 100 cycles at 0.5C rate, the two samples deliver capacity retentions of 96.63% and 93.23% of their initial capacities.

348.html,"A modified method for pesticide transport and fate in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field of Yangling, China","The Guanzhong region is one of the water resources shortage areas and also an important food producing area in Chinese Loess Plateau. The unreasonable application of irrigation and pesticide not only reduces the utilization rate of pesticides, but also is a potential threat to aquatic environments. In order to explore the reasonable application pattern of irrigation and pesticide, a modified method considering crop water requirement and pesticide transport was established to simulate transport and fate of Triadimefon in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field in Yangling, China. Results indicate that: (1) the modified method introduces the concepts of crop water requirement and irrigation schedule, which can estimate irrigation amount more accurately and achieve the goal of water saving and agricultural diffuse pollution control more efficiently. The method shows good potential applications and implications in predicting pesticide exposure levels of different crops and in reducing pesticide pollution. (2) The changing trends of soil pesticide levels under different pesticide applications are various. The Triadimefon concentration level in surface soil layer (0.005 m) was directly affected by pesticide application and irrigation. The Triadimefon peak below the soil depth of 0.035 m has prominently delayed effects and it is mainly affected by irrigations. The concentration of pesticides decays rapidly with the increase of soil depth, and it can be ignored below the depth of 0.5 m. (3) The soil pesticide levels under different pesticide and irrigation modes show considerable differences, the irrigation is still the most significant factor affecting the level of soil pesticide residues under different time intervals between pesticide application and irrigation. The irrigation scheme of one-day interval and five-divided irrigation can effectively reduce deep soil pollution without affecting the normal growth of crops. Results may provide theoretical basis and guide farmers to choose appropriate irrigation and pesticide application patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wu Lei; Chang Huanyu; Ma Xiaoyi,Key Laboratory of Agricultural Soil and Water Engineering in Arid and Semiarid Areas\Ministry of Education\China; College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering\Northwest A&F University\China; State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau\Northwest A&F University\China,-,Agricultural diffuse pollution; Crop water requirement; Irrigation schedule; Modified method; Pesticide transport and fate
349.html,"An integrated specification for the nexus of water pollution and economic growth in China: Panel cointegration, long-run causality and environmental Kuznets curve","This paper concentrates on a Chinese context and makes efforts to develop an integrated process to explicitly elucidate the relationship between economic growth and water pollution discharge—chemical oxygen demand (COD) discharge and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), using two unbalanced panel data sets covering the period separately from 1990 to 2014, and 2001 to 2014. In our present study, the panel unit root tests, cointegration tests, and Granger causality tests allowing for cross-sectional dependence, nonstationary, and heterogeneity are conducted to examine the causal effects of economic growth on COD/NH3-N discharge. Further, we simultaneously apply semi-parametric fixed effects estimation and parametric fixed effects estimation to investigate environmental Kuznets curve relationship for COD/NH3-N discharge. Our empirical results show a long-term bidirectional causality between economic growth and COD/NH3-N discharge in China. Within the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology framework, we find evidence in support of an inverted U-shaped curved link between economic growth and COD/NH3-N discharge. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any efforts made in investigating the nexus of economic growth and water pollution in such an integrated manner. Therefore, this study takes a fresh look on this topic. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Chen; Wang Yuan; Song Xiaowei; Kubota Jumpei; He Yanmin; Tojo Junji; Zhu Xiaodong,State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resources Reuse\School of the Environment\China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Humid Subtropical Eco-geographical Process\College of Geographical Sciences\China; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature\Kyoto\Japan; Institute of Economic Research\Kyoto University\Japan,-,COD/NH3-N discharge; Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets curve; Panel granger causality; Semi-parametric panel regression; STIRPAT

It comprises far more than 100 entries and gives the place, circumstances, content and date of the find, a description of the coins, the depository, publication and secondary literature. Coin hoards exist since the late 6th century and are strongly diversified in earlier times. Their size indicates non-private owners. Later the hoards become more homogenous; the coins point to trading partners and trade routes. The purpose of the accumulation or burial can be manifold: Loss by accident, grave goods, dedication to deities, foundation deposit, hoarding in times of crises. In the 4th century more and more imitated Athenian tetradrachms were coined in Egypt itself, which inter alia is indicated by dies that were found in Egypt. At the very end of the Pharaonic time indigenous gold coins were minted and also 'small change' in silver and bronze. Demotic and Aramaic texts allow conclusions regarding the dimensions of monetarization, Greek texts inform about foreign relations which brought foreign coins into the country. On the other side, coins were minted in order to pay foreign mercenaries, who could use the money to buy foreign products. Altogether one can state that mainly state expenditures, in particular during war times, fostered the minting of coins. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

350.html,Radionuclides and soil properties as indicators of glacier retreat in a recently deglaciated permafrost environment of the Maritime Antarctica,"Many ice-free environments in Maritime Antarctica are undergoing rapid and substantial environmental changes in response to recent climate trends. This is the case of Elephant Point (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, SSI), where the glacier retreat recorded during the last six decades exposed 17% of this small peninsula, namely a moraine extending from the western to the eastern coastlines and a relatively flat proglacial surface. In the southern margin of the peninsula, a sequence of Holocene raised beaches and several bedrock plateaus are also distributed. A main issue in this environment is the role of glacier retreat and permafrost controlling the recently formed soils. To this purpose, a total of 10 sites were sampled along a transect crossing raised beaches and moraine materials following the direction of glacier retreat. At the selected sites surface samples were collected until 12 cm depth and sectioned at 3 cm depth intervals to analyse main properties, grain size, pH, electrical conductivity and carbonates. Besides, elemental composition and fallout (FRNs) and environmental radionuclides (ERNs) were analysed. To assess if profile characteristics within the active layer are affected by glacier retreat variations of organic carbon and carbon fractions and137Cs contents were examined. The presence of organic carbon (range: 0.13–3.19%), and137Cs (range: bdl–10.1 Bq kg− 1) was only found at the raised beaches. The surface samples had abundant coarse fractions in rich sandy matrix with increasing acidic pH towards the coast. Significant differences were found in the elemental composition and the radionuclides between the moraine and raised beaches. Soil forming processes are related to the time of exposure of the landforms after glacier retreat. The results obtained confirm the potential for using geomorphological, edaphic and geochemical data to assess the influence of different stages of glacier retreat in recent soils and sediments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Navas Ana; Oliva Marc; Ruiz-Fernández Jesús; Gaspar Leticia; Quijano Laura; Lizaga Iván,Department of Soil and Water\Estación Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD-CSIC)\Spain; Department of Geography\University of Barcelona\Spain; Department of Geography\University of Oviedo\Spain; University of Northern British Columbia\3333 University Way\Canada,-,137Cs; Cryosols; Elephant Point; ERNs; Glacial landforms; SOC
351.html,Seasonal distribution of herbicide and insecticide residues in the water resources of the vineyard region of La Rioja (Spain),"Pesticides are needed to maintain high production in the vineyard area of La Rioja (Spain), and monitoring their spatial distribution is a priority for preserving the quality of natural resources. Accordingly, the purpose of this work was to conduct a study to evaluate the presence and seasonal distribution of herbicide and insecticide residues in ground and surface waters in this region. The monitoring network comprised 12 surface waters and 78 groundwaters, covering the three subareas (63,593 ha) into which the vineyard region is divided. The quality of natural waters was examined through the analysis of twenty-two herbicides, eight of their main degradation products, and eight insecticides. Pesticides were extracted by solid-phase extraction, and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results reveal the presence of most of the herbicides and insecticides included in the study in one or more of the samples collected during the four campaigns. The herbicide terbuthylazine and its metabolite desethylterbuthylazine were the compounds more frequently detected (present in > 65% of the samples across all the campaigns). Other compounds detected in > 50% of the samples in one sampling campaign were the herbicides fluometuron, metolachlor, alachlor and ethofumesate. Insecticides were present in a small number of samples, with only pirimicarb being detected in > 25% of the samples in March and June campaigns. The results reveal that the sum of compounds detected (mainly herbicides) was higher than 0.5 μg L− 1in > 50% of the samples, especially in the campaigns with the highest application of these compounds. A possible recovery of the quality of the waters was detected outside the periods of crop cultivation, although more monitoring programmes are needed to confirm this trend with a view to preventing and/or maintaining the sustainability of natural resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Herrero-Hernández Eliseo; Rodríguez-Cruz M.

352.html,"Arsenic, manganese and aluminum contamination in groundwater resources of Western Amazonia (Peru)","This paper presents a first integrated survey on the occurrence and distribution of geogenic contaminants in groundwater resources of Western Amazonia in Peru. An increasing number of groundwater wells have been constructed for drinking water purposes in the last decades; however, the chemical quality of the groundwater resources in the Amazon region is poorly studied. We collected groundwater from the regions of Iquitos and Pucallpa to analyze the hydrochemical characteristics, including trace elements. The source aquifer of each well was determined by interpretation of the available geological information, which identified four different aquifer types with distinct hydrochemical properties. The majority of the wells in two of the aquifer types tap groundwater enriched in aluminum, arsenic, or manganese at levels harmful to human health. Holocene alluvial aquifers along the main Amazon tributaries with anoxic, near pH-neutral groundwater contained high concentrations of arsenic (up to 700 μg/L) and manganese (up to 4 mg/L). Around Iquitos, the acidic groundwater (4.2 ≤ pH ≤ 5.5) from unconfined aquifers composed of pure sand had dissolved aluminum concentrations of up to 3.3 mg/L. Groundwater from older or deeper aquifers generally was of good chemical quality. The high concentrations of toxic elements highlight the urgent need to assess the groundwater quality throughout Western Amazonia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",de Meyer Caroline M.C.; Rodríguez Juan M.; Carpio Edward A.; García Pilar A.; Stengel Caroline; Berg Michael,Eawag Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology\Dübendorf\Switzerland; Facultad de Ciencias\Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería\Peru,-,Amazon River; Drinking water; Geogenic contamination; Holocene; Iquitos; Trace elements
353.html,Settlement patterns of the coral Acropora millepora on sediment-laden surfaces,"Successful recruitment in corals is important for the sustenance of coral reefs, and is considered a demographic bottleneck in the recovery of reef populations following disturbance events. Yet several factors influence larval settlement behaviour, and here we quantified thresholds associated with light attenuation and accumulated sediments on settlement substrates. Sediments deposited on calcareous red algae (CRA) directly and indirectly impacted coral settlement patterns. Although not avoiding direct contact, Acropora millepora larvae were very reluctant to settle on surfaces layered with sediments, progressively shifting their settlement preference from upward to downward facing (sediment-free) surfaces under increasing levels of deposited sediment. When only upward-facing surfaces were presented, 10% of settlement was inhibited at thresholds from 0.9 to 16 mg cm− 2(EC10), regardless of sediment type (carbonate and siliciclastic) or particle size (fine and coarse silt). These levels equate to a very thin (< 150 μm) veneer of sediment that occurs within background levels on reefs. Grooves within settlement surfaces slightly improved options for settlement on sediment-coated surfaces (EC10: 29 mg cm− 2), but were quickly infilled at higher deposited sediment levels. CRA that was temporarily smothered by sediment for 6 d became bleached (53% surface area), and inhibited settlement at ~ 7 mg cm− 2(EC10). A minor decrease in settlement was observed at high and very low light intensities when using suboptimal concentrations of a settlement inducer (CRA extract); however, no inhibition was observed when natural CRA surfaces along with more realistic diel-light patterns were applied. The low deposited sediment thresholds indicate that even a thin veneer of sediment can have consequences for larval settlement due to a reduction of optimal substrate. And while grooves and overhangs provide more settlement options in high deposition areas, recruits settling at these locations may be subject to ongoing stress from shading, competition, and sediment infilling. © 2017",Ricardo Gerard F.; Jones Ross J.; Nordborg Mikaela; Negri Andrew P.,Centre for Microscopy\Characterisation and Analysis\Australia; Australian Institute of Marine Science\Townsville\Australia; Western Australian Marine Science Institution\Perth\Australia,-,Concentration–response; Coral recruitment; Crustose coralline algae; Dredging; Light intensity
354.html,Spatiotemporal analysis of human exposure to halogenated flame retardant chemicals,"Human exposure to flame retardants occurs in microenvironments due to their ubiquitous presence in consumer products and building materials. Recent research suggests higher levels of exposure through elevated surface dust (ESD) compared to floor dust (FD). However, it is unclear whether this pattern is consistent in different microenvironments beyond the home. We hypothesized that time spent in various microenvironments will significantly modify the pattern of human exposure to flame retardant chemicals in ESD and FD. We tested this hypothesis by collecting time activity diaries from 43 participants; and by estimating human exposure to 10 polybrominated diphenyl ether and 8 non-polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardant chemicals, based on chemical concentrations measured in different microenvironments visited by the participants. The results of paired t-tests show that, with some notable exceptions, estimates of human exposure to most chemicals through ESD are statistically significantly higher for ∑ PBDE (p = 0.00) and ∑ non-PBDEs (p = 0.00) than through FD. This study reinforces the need to integrate temporal, locational, and elevation dimensions in assessing human exposure to potentially toxic flame retardant chemicals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Allgood Jaime M.; Vahid Kelsi Schechter; Jeeva Keerthanaa; Tang Ian W.; Ogunseitan Oladele A.,Department of Population Health & Disease Prevention\University of California\United States; Department of Prevention and Community Health\Milken Institute School of Public Health\United States; Industrial Hygiene\Environmental Health Division\United States,-,Chemical flame retardants; Elevated surface dust; Floor dust; Human exposure; Microenvironments; Time activity diary
355.html,Effect of irrigation and genotypes towards reduction in arsenic load in rice,"Arsenic (As) bioaccumulation in rice grains has been identified as a major problem in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world. Suitable rice genotypes along with proper water management practice regulating As levels in rice plants must be chosen and implemented. A field study was conducted to investigate the effect of continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation on the bioaccumulation of As in ten rice cultivars at three locations having different levels of soil As and irrigation water As. Results showed that As concentration in different parts of rice plants varied significantly (P < 0.0001) with rice genotypes and irrigation practices in the three study locations. Lower levels of As in rice were found in AWD irrigation practice compared to CF irrigation practice. Higher grain As bioaccumulation was detected in plants in areas of high soil As in combination with CF irrigation practice. Our data show that use of AWD irrigation practice with suitable genotypes led to 17 to 35% reduction in grain As level, as well as 7 to 38% increase in grain yield. Overall, this study advances our understanding that, for moderate to high levels of As contamination, the Binadhan-5, Binadhan-6, Binadhan-8, Binadhan-10 and BRRI dhan47 varieties were quite promising to mitigate As induced human health risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Islam Shofiqul; Rahman Mohammad Mahmudur; Naidu Ravi,Global Centre for Environmental Remediation (GCER)\Faculty of Science\Australia; Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment (CRC CARE)\The University of Newcastle\Australia; Department of Soil Science\Bangladesh Agricultural University\Bangladesh,-,Arsenic; Bioaccumulation; Mitigation strategies; Rice genotypes; Water management
356.html,A new tool for direct non-invasive evaluation of chlorophyll a content from diffuse reflectance measurements,"Chlorophyll is a key biochemical component that is responsible for photosynthesis and is an indicator of plant health. The effect of stressors can be determined by measuring the amount of chlorophyll a, which is the most abundant chlorophyll, in vegetation in general. Nowadays, invasive methods and vegetation indices are used for establishing chlorophyll amount or an approximation to this value, respectively. This paper demonstrates that H-point curve isolation method (HPCIM) is useful for isolating the signal of chlorophyll a from non-invasive diffuse reflectance measurements of leaves. Spinach plants have been chosen as an example. For applying the HPCIM only the registers of both, a standard and the sample are needed. The results obtained by HPCIM and the invasive method were statistically similar for spinach leaves: 144 ± 6 mg/m2(n = 5) and 155 ± 40 mg/m2(n = 5), respectively. However, more precise values were achieved with the HPCIM, which also involved minimal experimental effort. The HPCIM method was applied to spinach plants stressed by the action of several pesticides and water scarcity, showing a decrease of chlorophyll a content with time, which is related with a loss of health. The results obtained were compared with those achieved by two different reflectance vegetation indices (Macc01 and NDVI). Although NDVI and HPCIM gave similar footprints for the plants tested, vegetation indices fail in the estimation of real content of the chlorophyll a. The HPCIM could contribute to improve the knowledge of the chlorophyll a content of vegetation like health indicator, by applying it to a much employed non-invasive technique such as diffuse reflectance, which can be used in place or in remote sensing mode. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,MINTOTA research group\Departament de Química Analítica\Spain,-,Chlorophyll a; H-point curve isolation method; Non-invasive; Plant health; Plant stress; Vegetation reflectance indices

The results indicated that the measured airflow rate distribution appeared Trapezium when the height was 20 cm; however, the airflow rate matched a Gaussian distribution when the heights became 30 cm and 40 cm. The conical shape of the ZOI was observed in the experimental processes. The experimental results verified that the airflow distribution within the ZOI conformed to turbulent jet theory. According to turbulent jet theory, the distribution of the airflow rate changes from Trapezium to Gaussian, and the jet boundary mixed layer is a linear extension in the processes of jets. Through our study, it was found that this theory could be applied to airflow distribution and predictive models for the ZOI in air sparging remediation. The shape of the ZOI should be cone-like and the boundary layer of the ZOI is a linear extension in air sparging process. All the results from this study can provide theoretical support for the design and prediction of air sparging remediation for groundwater pollution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yao Meng; Kang Xuehe; Zhao Yongsheng; Qin Chuanyu; Yang Yuanyuan; Li Bowen,Key Laboratory of Groundwater Resources and Environment\Ministry of Education\China,-,Air sparging; Airflow distribution; Cone; Turbulent jet; Zone of influence (ZOI)

Pollution at very low concentrations appears to be broad in environmental compartments near populated areas. A total of 42 drugs of abuse and metabolites were analysed in surface water samples collected in 2012 and 2013 by solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Analytical results of target compounds were georeferenced and integrated into a geographical information systems (GIS). Ecotoxicological risk of drugs of abuse detected in the Turia River was evaluated in this study by calculating risk quotient (RQ). In 2012, 6 compounds were detected in a total of 22 points. In 2013, 7 compounds were found in a total of 31 sampling sites, 4 of them also detected in 2012. The most frequent compound was benzoylecgonine, detected in 9 sampling points in 2012 and 8 in 2013, at an average concentration of 25.4 ng/L and 14.02 ng/L. Codeine reached the maximum concentration of detected compounds (101 ng/L) in 2013. GIS provided the spatial incidence of drugs of abuse along the Turia River basin. The distribution of these compounds in 2012 and 2013 shows that the highest concentrations and frequency of drugs of abuse run into places with the highest population density. The RQ obtained from measured concentrations of detected drugs predict that no short-term environmental risk might be expected.

359.html,First observation of labile arsenic stratification in aluminum sulfate-amended sediments using high resolution Zr-oxide DGT,"Arsenic contamination in sediments has received increasing attention because it may be released to the water and threaten aquatic organisms. In this study, aluminum sulfate (ALS) was used to immobilize As in sediments through dosage-series and time-series experiments. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) was used to obtain labile As at a vertically 2.0 mm resolution. Our results indicated that a “static” layer with extremely low labile As concentration (minimally 0.13 mg L− 1) with weak variation (< 30% RSD) formed within the top 12 mm sediment layer at the dosage of 6–12 ALS/Asmobile(kmol mol− 1, Asmobilemeans the total mobile As in top 40 mm sediment) and on days 30–80 after amendment at the dosage of 9 ALS/Asmobile. The maximum labile As decreased from 1.83 to 0.99 μg L− 1and from 1.96 to 1.20 μg L− 1in the dosage-series (3–12 ALS/Asmobile) and time-series (10–80 days) experiments, respectively, while the depths showing the maximal concentrations moved deeper from 22 to 34 mm and 20 to 32 mm in the sediments. It implied a reduced upward diffusion potential of labile As to the static layer in deeper sediments. Both distribution coefficient for As between sediment solid pool and pore water (Kd) and the adsorption rate constant (k1) consistently increased, reflecting that As release from sediment solid became increasingly difficult with the progress of ALS immobilization. The results of this millimeter-scale investigation showed that ALS could efficiently immobilize As in sediments under simulated conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lin Juan; Sun Qin; Ding Shiming; Wang Dan; Wang Yan; Tsang Daniel C.W.,State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment\Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resource Development on Shallow Lakes\Ministry of Education\China; Shanghai Waterway Engineering Design and Consulting Co.

The object of the research was the system of marks used by workmen who constructed the New Kingdom royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, and who were housed at Deir el-Medina. The workmen's marks were used to express ownership of pottery vessels and other objects, to express identity in graffiti and votive inscriptions, and to compose administrative texts on ostraca. Through the combination of personal marks with numbers, dates, and a range of further icons denoting commodities and calendar months, the marks developed into a pseudo-script with the potential to communicate information very similar to the data offered by regular hieratic administrative writing. The investigation has resulted in clarifying aspects of this particular marking system, such as its use and purpose, the identity of the workmen represented by the marks, and the dating of many individual records. It has also revealed much about the relative importance of and interaction between this system of visual communication and writing. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

Moreover, this increase is expected to continue in the future. However, there is a lack of standardized sampling and metric methods to measure the level of exposure to nanoparticles, and the information related to possible adverse health effects is scarce. Aerosol technology has been detecting and characterizing nanoparticles for decades and some of their developments can be of use in nanotechnology characterization. We present here two current developments based on used principles in aerosol science, which can widen its application to the characterization of nanomaterials. On the one hand, a sample preparation technique for nanoparticle analysis by electron microscopy based on electrospray atomization technology. Several samples prepared in this way have been analysed and compared to more traditional sample preparation strategies like the “drop on grid” method. It was found that the particles deposited by electrospray generally show a much more homogeneous spatial distribution on the substrate and the number of single particles increases substantially. On the other hand, it is presented an electrical mobility classification system, DMA, with enormous possibilities for the quick and economic size characterization of suspensions of nanoparticles, thanks to its injection system by electrospray and to its high resolution in the lower range of the nanoscale. The first assessment of the abovementioned devices highlights its potential applications in exposure assessment and nanotechnological contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Mugica Iñaki; Fito Carlos; Domat Maidá; Dohányosová Pavla; Gutierrez-Cañas Cristina; López-Vidal Silvia,RAMEM S.A\C/ Verano 9\Spain; ITENE\C/ Albert Einstein\Spain; Department of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering\University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU\Spain,-,Aerosol science; Differential Mobility Analyser; Electrospray; Nanomaterial; Nanoparticle
361.html,"Assessment of biodegradation potential at a site contaminated by a mixture of BTEX, chlorinated pollutants and pharmaceuticals using passive sampling methods – Case study","The present study describes a pilot remediation test of a co-mingled plume containing BTEX, chlorinated pollutants and pharmaceuticals. Remediation was attempted using a combination of various approaches, including a pump and treat system applying an advanced oxidation process and targeted direct push injections of calcium peroxide. The remediation process was monitored intensively and extensively throughout the pilot test using various conventional and passive sampling methods, including next-generation amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the injection of oxygen-saturated treated water with residual hydrogen peroxide and elevated temperature enhanced the in situ removal of monoaromatics and chlorinated pollutants. In particular, in combination with the injection of calcium peroxide, the conditions facilitated the in situ bacterial biodegradation of the pollutants. The mean groundwater concentration of benzene decreased from 1349 μg·L− 1prior to the test to 3 μg·L− 1within 3 months after the calcium peroxide injections; additionally, monochlorobenzene decreased from 1545 μg·L− 1to 36 μg·L− 1, and toluene decreased from 143 μg·L− 1to 2 μg·L− 1. Furthermore, significant degradation of the contaminants bound to the soil matrix in less permeable zones was observed. Based on a developed 3D model, 90% of toluene and 88% of chlorobenzene bound to the soil were removed during the pilot test, and benzene was removed almost completely. On the other hand, the psychopharmaceuticals were effectively removed by the employed advanced oxidation process only from the treated water, and their concentration in groundwater remained stagnant due to inflow from the surroundings and their absence of in situ degradation. The employment of passive sampling techniques, including passive diffusion bags (PDB) for volatile organic pollutants and their respective transformation products, polar organic compound integrative samplers (POCIS) for the pharmaceuticals and in situ soil microcosms for microbial community analysis, was proven to be suitable for monitoring remediation in saturated zones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lhotský Ondřej; Krákorová Eva; Linhartová Lucie; Křesinová Zdena; Steinová Jana; Dvořák Lukáš; Rodsand Torgeir; Filipová Alena; Kroupová Kristýna; Wimmerová Lenka; Kukačka Jan; Cajthaml Tomáš,DEKONTA a.s.\Volutová 2523\Czech Republic; Institute for Environmental Studies\Faculty of Science\Czech Republic; Institute of Microbiology Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic\v.v.i.\Czech Republic; Technical University of Liberec\Studentská 2\Czech Republic,-,Advance oxidation process; Biodegradation; BTEX; Groundwater; Oxygen release compounds; Pharmaceuticals

Recently, high concentration of bloom cyanobacteria had been found to accelerate total nitrogen (TN) removal. However, the contribution of cyanobacterial bloom to TN removal remained unclear. In this study, microcosms with different density of bloom cyanobacteria were constructed and quantitative PCR and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to analyze the microbes, environmental variables and the causal relationship to TN removal. Total bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nirS gene abundances were indirectly influenced by cyanobacteria biomass and all of them had a direct effect on TN removal. SEM confirmed that cyanobacteria made a direct contribution to ammonium‑nitrogen (NH4+-N) level in water and induced nitrification activity, which favored the process of denitrification by supplying substrate and aggravating the anoxic status. These results strongly suggested that an increased cyanobacteria biomass had strong impacts on mineralization, nitrification and denitrification by mediating TN, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved oxygen directly and subsequently influenced the nitrifiers and denitrifiers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Peng Yuke; Liu Lu; Jiang Lijuan; Xiao Lin,School of the Environment\Nanjing University\China,-,Bloom cyanobacteria; Denitrification; Nitrogen removal; qPCR; SEM
363.html,Long-term no-tillage and organic input management enhanced the diversity and stability of soil microbial community,"Intensive tillage and high inputs of chemicals are frequently used in conventional agriculture management, which critically depresses soil properties and causes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution. Conservation practices, such as no-tillage and organic farming, have potential to enhance soil health. However, the long-term impact of no-tillage and organic practices on soil microbial diversity and community structure has not been fully understood, particularly in humid, warm climate regions such as the southeast USA. We hypothesized that organic inputs will lead to greater microbial diversity and a more stable microbial community, and that the combination of no-tillage and organic inputs will maximize soil microbial diversity. We conducted a long-term experiment in the southern Appalachian mountains of North Carolina, USA to test these hypotheses. The results showed that soil microbial diversity and community structure diverged under different management regimes after long term continuous treatments. Organic input dominated the effect of management practices on soil microbial properties, although no-tillage practice also exerted significant impacts. Both no-tillage and organic inputs significantly promoted soil microbial diversity and community stability. The combination of no-tillage and organic management increased soil microbial diversity over the conventional tillage and led to a microbial community structure more similar to the one in an adjacent grassland. These results indicate that effective management through reducing tillage and increasing organic C inputs can enhance soil microbial diversity and community stability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Yi; Li Chunyue; Tu Cong; Hoyt Greg D.; DeForest Jared L.; Hu Shuijin,State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology\Institute of Earth Environment\China; Department of Entomology & Plant Pathology\North Carolina State University\United States; School of Geography and Tourism\Shaanxi Normal University\China; Department of Soil Science\North Carolina State University\United States,-,Conventional farming; Microbial community; Microbial diversity; Organic farming; Sustainable agriculture; Tillage
364.html,Disinfection of various bacterial pathogens using novel silver nanoparticle-decorated magnetic hybrid colloids,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have long been considered a powerful disinfectant for controlling pathogenic microorganisms. However, AgNPs might have adverse effects on both human health and our ecosystems due to their potential cytotoxicity and the difficulty in recovering them after their release into the environment. In this study, we characterized the antimicrobial efficacy caused by a novel micrometer-sized magnetic hybrid colloid (MHC) containing 7, 15, or 30 nm sized monodispersed AgNPs (AgNP-MHCs), which can be re-collected from the environment using simple procedures, such as a magnet or centrifugation. We evaluated the antibacterial capabilities of AgNP-MHCs against target bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens) and compared them with the inactivation efficacy of AgNPs ~ 30 nm in diameter (nAg30s). Among the different AgNP-MHCs composites evaluated, Ag30-MHCs had the greatest antibacterial effect. After 1 h of exposure, more than a 4-log10reduction of L. pneumophila and 6-log10reduction of B. subtilis was achieved by 4.6 × 109particles/mL of Ag30-MHCs and Ag30-MHC-Ls. In addition, Ag30-MHC-Ls maintained their strong antibacterial capabilities under anaerobic conditions. Our results indicate that AgNP-MHCs can be considered excellent tools for controlling waterborne bacterial pathogens, with a minimal risk of release into the environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Park SungJun; Park Hye Hun; Ko Young-Seon; Lee Su Jin; Le The Son; Woo Kyoungja; Ko GwangPyo,Department of Environmental Health Sciences\Graduate School of Public Health\South Korea; N-Bio\Seoul National University\South Korea; Nanophotonics Research Center\Korea Institute of Science and Technology\South Korea,-,Aerobic; Anaerobic; Antibacterial agents; Disinfection; Magnetic hybrid colloid; Silver nanoparticle

The aim of this study was finding a suitable solution using ozone and UVA irradiation combined with TiO2catalysts doped with different noble metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic ozonation required lower amounts of ozone for higher efficiency on the removal of parabens, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC). The best catalyst for the initial contaminants degradation was 0.5% Ag-TiO2leading to total parabens removal using 46 mgO3/L. Due to the relative low mineralization achieved, the toxicity of the treated solutions was still compared with the initial one over several species (Vibrio fischeri, Lepidium sativum and Corbicula fluminea). All the treatments applied led to a clear decrease on the toxicity compared with initial mixture of parabens. From an economical point of view, it was concluded that the presence of UVA irradiation increased the energy consumption compared with catalytic ozonation with these catalysts but it can decrease the time of reaction. From the by-products analysis, it was concluded that hydroxylation appears to be the most significant reaction pathway and the main responsible for parabens degradation. © 2017",Gomes João F.; Leal Inês; Bednarczyk Katarzyna; Gmurek Marta; Stelmachowski Marek; Diak Magdalena; Costa Raquel; Quinta-Ferreira Rosa M.; Martins Rui C.,CIEPQPF – Chemical Engineering Processes and Forest Products Research Center\Department of Chemical Engineering\Portugal; Faculty of Process and Environmental Engineering\Department of Safety Engineering Lodz University of Technology\Poland; Faculty of Process and Environmental Engineering\Department of Bioprocess Engineering\Poland; Faculty of Chemistry\Department of Environmental Technology\Poland,-,By-products analysis; Cost evaluation; Doped TiO2; Parabens degradation; Photocatalytic ozonation; Toxicity
366.html,"The use of augmented-reality technology to improve judo techniques. Premises, assumptions, methodology, research tools, preliminary scenarios - The first stage of the study","Background & Study Aim: Sport, professionally and for all, is an area of both the application of modern technology, and to create new ones. The premises of such a statement is to protect health (all practitioners sport) and to achieve optimal sport results first of all by top athletes. In judo, like in each combat sports, motoric actions are cumulative directly on the body of an athlete during a specific exercise (kata, uchi komi etc.), training fights (randori) and the tournaments ones. The aim of this work are the most important premises based on the analysis of the available technology, augmented reality (AR) in relation to the expectations of adaptive judo athletes (under the scientific knowledge about the determinants of success) and assumptions construction of research tools and training, including initial scenarios. Material & Methods: We use the design method and the Delphi method involving the science of martial arts experts’ (2 professors sport science and at the same time judo coaches master class, 1 professor management science and judo coach first class, 1 PhD and three times of Judo Word Champion, 1 PhD and Karate World Champion). In our opinion, an essential value of the project are not only the methods but also the selection of experts (all of the scientific qualifications and experience of the practice of combat sports). The selection of only those people who possess abilities to perform scientific analysis of a studied phenomenon has been a very essential criterion from methodological perspective. Results: All the experts agreed that the essence of judo sport is to maintain a vertical posture and break the balance competitor. Only such a result makes it possible to continue the fight in the horizontal posture. However, these two general principles does not mean that they are fighting techniques of judo to ensure reliability. Conclusion: Therefore design methodology of teaching and perfecting judo techniques using AR cannot ignore these rules. © 2016 the Authors.

367.html,Environmental footprints of brick kiln bottom ashes: Geostatistical approach for assessment of metal toxicity,"Coal fired brick kiln factories generate significant of brick kiln bottom ash (BKBA) that contaminate soil and water environments of areas near the dumping sites through leaching of toxic metals (Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn, Mn, and Cu). However, characteristics and environmental effects of BKBAs are yet unknown. We collected BKBA samples from 32 strategic locations of two rapidly developing States (West Bengal and Assam) of India. Scanning electron microscope images indicated spherical and granular structures of BKBAs produced in West Bengal (WBKBA) and Assam (ABKBA) respectively; while energy dispersive spectroscopy and analytical assessments confirmed substantial occurrence of total organic C and nutrient elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) in both the BKBAs. FTIR analysis revealed greater predominance of organic matter in ABKBAs than WBKBAs. Occurrence of toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Mn, and Cu) was higher in ABKBAs than in WBKBAs; while organic and residual fractions of metals were highly predominant in most of the BKBAs. Principal component analysis showed that metal contents and pH were the major distinguishing characteristics of the BKBAs generated in the two different environmental locations. Human health risk associated with BKBAs generated in Assam is of significant concern. Finally, geo-statistical tools enabled to predict the spatial distribution patterns of toxic metals contributed by the BKBAs in Assam and West Bengal respectively. Assessment of contamination index, geo-accumulation index, and ecological risk index revealed some BKBAs to be more toxic than others. © 2017",Mondal Ananya; Das Subhasish; Sah Rajesh Kumar; Bhattacharyya Pradip; Bhattacharya Satya Sundar,Agricultural and Ecological Research Unit\Indian Statistical Institute\India; Soil and Agro Bio-engineering Laboratory\Department of Environmental Science\India; Remote Sensing and GIS Laboratory\Department of Environmental Science\India,-,Contamination index; Geo-accumulation index; Health hazard; Potential toxic elements
368.html,The impact of two large floods (1993–1994) on sediment deposition in the Rhône delta: Implications for sustainable management,"In October 1993 and January 1994, two large floods with peak discharge of 9800 and 10,980 m3/s and total suspended solid transport of 10.7 × 106and 9.7 × 106tons, respectively, occurred on the Rhône River. Both floods led to multiple levee breeches in the Northern part of the delta resulting in the introduction of 131 × 106and 54.9 × 106m3of river water, respectively. In both cases, the flood water drained to the southern lagoons and was partly pumped directly back to the Rhône or to the sea. Most of the 390,000 tons of sediment introduced remained in the Northern inundated area with accretion ranging from 70 mm near the breaches to 4 mm 6–8 km away. This last value is close to the mean accretion value (3.7 mm) inferred from the water budget and the estimation of the total quantity of sediment introduced in the flooded area. In a small area near the mouth of the Rhône river still receiving natural overflow from the river, total deposition during both floods was as high as 10 cm. The Rhône delta is facing an uncertain future with projected sea-level rise. The results of this study show that large introductions of river water can help sustain the delta in the face of climate change. Controlled introductions of river water using riverside closable structures, as in being done in other deltas, could be done in a way that delivers water and sediments to the places where it is needed most and at the same time protect important infrastructure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pont Didier; Day John W.; Ibáñez Carles,Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies\Institute of Social Ecology\Austria; Dept. of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences\College of the Coast and Environment\United States; Aquatic Ecosystems Program\IRTA\Spain,-,-
369.html,Long-term variations in sediment heavy metals of a reservoir with changing trophic states: Implications for the impact of climate change,"Two dated sediment cores from the Miyun Reservoir of Beijing in China were analyzed to reconstruct the pollution history of heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) as well as phosphorus (P). Enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) were applied to assess the enrichment status of heavy metals. Average EF and Igeovalues indicated that the studied heavy metals in the sediments mainly originated from non-point source pollution and soil-water erosion, showing low ecological risks. In addition, correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) identified that Cd, Zn, and P were mainly from agricultural diffusion pollution caused by utilization of the phosphate fertilizer; Zn, Ni, and Cr originated from soil erosion. PCA analysis was further conducted to investigate the relationships among meteorological factors, algae-dominant total organic carbon (TOC), and heavy metals. Results showed that algae-dominant TOC had strong positive correlation with temperature, which can be explained by that increased temperature accelerated the growth of algae. Meanwhile the opposite loadings between algae-dominant TOC and heavy metal suggested that primary production played an important role in migration and transformation of metals. Moreover, stepwise multiple regression models showed that Fe was sensitive to temperature, which accounted for approximately 39.0% and 40.1% of the variations in Fe of two sediment cores, respectively. Fe showed significant decreasing trends during the past 50 years. Reductive environment of water-sediment interface caused by increasing temperature probably contributed to the restoration of ferric iron, resulting in the release of soluble Fe to overlying waters. Future climate change with elevated temperature and extreme weather events will aggravate the ecological risk of heavy metals in water environment due to the enhanced leaching effect and non-point source pollution as well as the release of heavy metals from sediments to water environment. © 2017",Wu Qiong; Qi Jun; Xia Xinghui,School of Environment\Beijing Normal University-State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation\China; Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection\Beijing\China,-,Climate change; Eutrophic states; Heavy metals; Reservoir sediments; Risk assessment
37.html,Archaeology in Russia today - the system of scientific control over the quality of rescue archaeology work,"In Russia, there are approximately 60,000 registered archaeological sites and over 1500 archaeological projects are undertaken annually. Rescue archaeology projects undertaken in Russia have risen significantly, now accounting for over 70% of all archaeological research in Russia. The principle recent trend is a sharp increase in the proportion of rescue archaeology projects undertaken by non-State companies. Since 2006 the number of projects undertaken by private companies has more than trebled. By 2012-2013 their share of the overall number of projects had risen to around 40%. The pace of change is largely due to Russia's taxation system. Economic reform has enabled tax-breaks stimulating the growth of non-State business. Yet State organisations (museums, universities, affiliates of the RAS) enjoy none of these tax breaks. The playing field is not level - making it more attractive for both the contractors and the clients of such works to use non-governmental agencies. This situation raises the serious question of the scientific control of such works. © Archaeopress, UISPP and authors 2017.

Several studies have been undertaken on the structural characterization of DOM, but its fate during drinking water treatment processes is still not fully understood. In this work, the nontargeted screening method of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC × GC-qMS) was used to reveal the detailed changes of different chemical classes of compounds in DOM during conventional and advanced drinking water treatment processes at three drinking water treatment plants in China. The results showed that when the dissolved organic carbon removal was low, shifts in the DOM composition could not be detected with the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, but the changes were clear in the three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix or GC × GC-qMS analyses. Coagulation-sedimentation processes selectively removed 37–59% of the nitrogenous compounds, alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons but increased the concentrations of halogen-containing compounds by 17–26% because of the contact time with chlorine in this step. Filtration was less efficient at removing DOM but preferentially removed 21–60% of the acids. However, other organic matter would be released from the filter (e.g., nitrogenous compounds, acids, and aromatic hydrocarbons). Biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment removed most of the compounds produced from ozonation, particularly ketones, alcohols, halogen-containing compounds and acids. However, it should be noted that certain highly polar or high molecular weight compounds not identified in this study might be released from the BAC bed. After the whole treatment processes, the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds, alcohols, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones were decreased more by the advanced treatment processes than by the conventional treatment processes. Alcohol and ketone removals were probably related to the reduction in protein-like materials. Alkane removal was probably related to the reduction in fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Chunmei; Wang Donghong; Xu Xiong; Xu Meijia; Wang Zijian; Xiao Ruiyang,Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Science\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Institute of Environmental Engineering\School of Metallurgy and Environment\China,-,Chemical classes; Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry; Dissolved organic matter; Drinking water treatment
371.html,Molecular basis for oxidative stress induced by simulated microgravity in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,"Caenorhabditis elegans is an important in vivo assay system for toxicological studies. Herein, we investigated the role of oxidative stress and the underlying molecular mechanism for induced adverse effects of simulated microgravity. In nematodes, simulated microgravity treatment induced a significant induction of oxidative stress. Genes (mev-1, gas-1, and isp-1) encoding a molecular machinery for the control of oxidative stress were found to be dysregulated in simulated microgravity treated nematodes. Meanwhile, genes (sod-2, sod-3, sod-4, sod-5, aak-2, skn-1, and gst-4) encoding certain antioxidant defense systems were increased in simulated microgravity treated nematodes. Mutation of mev-1, gas-1, sod-2, sod-3, aak-2, skn-1, or gst-4 enhanced susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by simulated microgravity, whereas mutation of isp-1 induced a resistance to oxidative stress induced by simulated microgravity. Mutation of sod-2, sod-3, or aak-2 further suppressed the recovery effect of simulated microgravity toxicity in nematodes after simulated microgravity treatment for 1 h. Moreover, administration of ascorbate could inhibit the adverse effects including the induction of oxidative stress in simulated microgravity treated nematodes. Mutation of any of the genes encoding metallothioneins or the genes of hsp-16.1, hsp-16.2 and hsp-16.48 encoding heat-shock proteins did not affect the induction of oxidative stress in simulated microgravity treated nematodes.

372.html,Evaluation of heavy metal mobilization in creek sediment: Influence of RAC values and ambient environmental factors,"The risk assessment code (RAC) is a common method for assessing heavy metal (HM) mobility and their potential health risks, based on HM total concentration and chemical speciation. In this study, both the RAC and the influence of ambient environmental factors were investigated in a river sediment system. Sixty-eight sediment samples were collected from the main river system in Shanghai, China. The total concentration and chemical speciation of Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr, As, and Hg were determined in the samples. The influence of sediment environmental factors, such as acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), Fe & Mn, and total organic carbon (TOC), on total metal concentrations and speciation was also investigated. The relationship between the main environmental media and distribution of HMs was discussed using PCA and NMDS. The transfer-transformation behaviors of Pb, Ni, and Cr were mainly controlled by AVS and TOC while Zn, Cu, and Cd were influenced by Fe & Mn and TOC. The relationship between the RAC value of HM and environmental factors revealed that 7% of Cr, 23% of Ni, and 15% of Pb had a high risk of mobility at TOC values below 3.5% and sulfite contents below 10 mmol/kg. In comparison, 29%, 10%, and 10% of Zn, Cu, and Cd, respectively, had a high risk of mobility at TOC < 3.5% and Fe & Mn content > 4 × 105mg/kg. Evidently, the chemical fractions of HM had a strong dependence on the S, Fe, Mn, and organic compounds in the sediment. This study provides a promising pathway for the rapid evaluation of potential risks from HMs in river sediments. © 2017",Liang Guannan; Zhang Bo; Lin Mao; Wu Simiao; Hou Hao; Zhang Jia; Qian Guangren; Huang Xin; Zhou Jizhi,School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering\Shanghai University\China; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment\Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences\China; Center of Solid Waste Management\Shanghai\China,-,Heavy metals; Multivariate analysis techniques; Risk assessment; Sediment
373.html,Restoring low-input high-diversity grasslands as a potential global resource for biofuels,"Reducing meat consumption by humans and shifting to more efficient plant and animal protein sources could potentially free up large areas of pasture and feedcrop agricultural land for restoration or conversion to low-input high-diversity (LIHD) grasslands. LIHD grasslands improve biodiversity, carbon sequestration, erosion control, water storage, while also providing opportunities to produce biofuels. We examined the potential of converting pastures globally, and animal feedstock agricultural lands in the USA and Brazil, to LIHD biomass sources and the capacity of these systems to meet national energy demands via (1) cellulosic ethanol and (2) integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis (IGCC-FT) processing. Our analyses, which we argue are conservative, indicate that large amounts of energy, far in excess of many country's current demands, can potentially be produced from IGCC-FT processing of grassland biomass grown on converted pastures, especially in tropical developing countries. Over 40 countries could meet ≥ 100% of their domestic demands for electricity, gasoline, and diesel. If energy products were shared between countries, the 95 countries with positive energy production yields could meet 46%, 28%, and 39% of their combined electricity, gasoline, and diesel demands, respectively. While it is clearly unrealistic to propose a 100% conversion of pasture lands to biofuel production, these analyses highlight the potential gains in ecosystem services and energy production that could theoretically be achieved on already-managed lands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Machovina Brian; Feeley Kenneth J.,Department of Biological Sciences\Florida International University\United States; Department of Biology\University of Miami\United States; Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden\Coral Gables\United States,-,Biofuel; Fischer-Tropsch; Grasslands; Restoration; Syngas
374.html,"Global distribution of dissolved organic matter along the aquatic continuum: Across rivers, lakes and oceans","Based on an extensive literature survey containing more than 12,000 paired measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) distributed over four continents and seven oceans, we described the global distribution and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along the aquatic continuum across rivers and lakes to oceans. A strong log-linear relationship (R2= 0.92) between DOC concentration and CDOM absorption at 350 nm was observed at a global scale, but was found to be ecosystem-dependent at local and regional scales. Our results reveal that as DOM is transported towards the oceans, the robustness of the observed relation decreases rapidly (R2from 0.94 to 0.44) indicating a gradual decoupling between DOC and CDOM. This likely reflects the decreased connectivity between the landscape and DOM along the aquatic continuum. To support this hypothesis, we used the DOC-specific UV absorbance (SUVA) to characterize the reactivity of the DOM pool which decreased from 4.9 to 1.7 m2× gC−1along the aquatic continuum. Across the continuum, a piecewise linear regression showed that the observed decrease of SUVA occurred more rapidly in freshwater ecosystems compared to marine water ecosystems, suggesting that the different degradation processes act preferentially on CDOM rather than carbon content. The observed change in the DOM characteristics along the aquatic continuum also suggests that the terrestrial DOM pool is gradually becoming less reactive, which has profound consequences on cycling of organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Massicotte Philippe; Asmala Eero; Stedmon Colin; Markager Stiig,Aarhus University\Department of Bioscience\Denmark; Technical University of Denmark\National Institute for Aquatic Resources\Denmark,-,Absorption; Biogeochemistry; Carbon cycling; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM); Dissolved organic carbon (DOC); Specific UV absorbance (SUVA)

Their colloidal properties enable their injection into porous media, i.e. soils and aquifers, and offer a higher efficiency in removing contaminants. However, this dispersed state is also the cause of concerns over their environmental fate and toxicity, e.g., by increasing the exposure time to aquatic organisms in groundwater remediation activities. Therefore, the objective of in situ groundwater remediation is to establish local reactive barriers in the subsurface by injection by means of reactive colloids with a controllable mobility under in situ conditions and present as colloids as shortly as possible. In this work, we examined the toxicity of humic acid-coated colloidal goethite nanoparticles in Daphnia magna. The adaptation of the ecotoxicological standard tests for nanomaterials is intensely discussed to increase comparability and reliability of results. In the present study, the effect of different exposure conditions on goethite nanoparticles colloidal behaviour and acute Daphnia immobilization effects was investigated. For this purpose, iron concentration in the water column, aggregation state and acute effects were studied in: i) a standard test, ii) test design with exposure dispersions incubated for a week and iii) water accommodated fraction. Despite the different aggregation and settling of the particles found between the approaches tested, no differences in toxicity were observed. Coated nanoparticles were found clogging up the filtering apparatus, and/or adhered to the exoskeleton, hindering the swimming and molting, and causing the immobilization and death of the organisms at doses of ≥ 943 mg/L (EC50). The data suggests that the toxic potential of these nanoparticles is mainly related to the physical interaction with the daphnids. © 2017 The Authors",-,LEITAT Technological Center\c/Pallars 179-185\Spain; Institut für Geowissenschaften\Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena\Germany,-,Acute toxicity; Colloidal goethite nanoparticles; Daphnia magna; Humic acid; Physical effect

The aim of this study was to assess the wastewater contamination of surface waters and sediments of three melt-water streams (11 sites) by leaking septic tanks located in the vicinity of the Uruguayan Scientific Station in the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, during summer 2015. For this purpose, we combined the analysis of fecal steroids in sediments by using gas chromatography and six enteric viruses in surface waters by quantitative and qualitative PCR. Coprostanol concentrations (from 0.03 to 3.31 μg g− 1) and fecal steroids diagnostic ratios indicated that stations C7 and C8 located in the kitchen stream presented sewage contamination. Rotavirus was the only enteric virus detected in five sites with concentration ranging from 1.2 × 105gc L−1to 5.1 × 105gc L−1being three of them located downstream from the leaking AINA and Kitchen septic tanks. This study shows for the first time the presence of both virological and molecular biomarkers of wastewater pollution in surface waters and sediments of three melt-water streams in the vicinity of a scientific station in the Antarctica. These results highlight the importance of the complementation of these biomarkers in two different matrices (surface waters and sediments) to assess wastewater pollution in an Antarctic environment related to anthropogenic activities in the area. © 2017",-,Laboratorio de Virología Molecular\Sede Salto del CENUR Litoral Norte\Uruguay; Laboratorio de Biogeoquímica Marina\IECA\Uruguay; Oceanografía y Ecología Marina\IECA\Uruguay; Laboratorio de Virología Molecular\Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares\Uruguay,-,Antarctica; Enteric viruses; Sediment; Sterols; Surface water

At high elevations, rockfall is largely climate-driven, very probably because of the warming of rock-wall permafrost. So with the ongoing global warming that drives the degradation of permafrost, the related hazards for people and infrastructure could continue to increase. The heatwave of summer 2015, which affected Western Europe from the end of June to August, had a serious impact on the stability of high-altitude rock-walls, including those in the Mont Blanc massif. A network of observers allowed us to survey the frequency and intensity of rock-wall morphodynamics in 2015, and to verify its relationship with permafrost. These observations were compared with those of the 2003 summer heatwave, identified and quantified by remote sensing. A comparison between the two years shows a fairly similar rockfall pattern in respect of total volumes and high frequencies (about 160 rockfalls > 100 m3) but the total volume for 2003 is higher than the 2015 one (about 300,000 m3and 170,000 m3respectively). In both cases, rockfalls were numerous but with a low magnitude and occurred in permafrost-affected areas. This suggests a sudden and remarkable deepening of the active layer during these two summers, rather than a longer-term warming of the permafrost body. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,EDYTEM Lab\University Savoie Mont Blanc — CNRS\France; Department of Geosciences\University of Oslo\Norway,-,Active layer; Mont Blanc massif; Permafrost; Rockfall; Summer heatwave

However, non-raptor birds are also poisoned (rodenticide exposure resulting in adverse effects including mortality) by rodenticides through consumption of the rodenticide bait and contaminated prey. A literature search for rodenticide incidents (evidence of exposure to a rodenticide, adverse effects, or exposure to placebo baits) involving non-raptor birds returned 641 records spanning the years 1931 to 2016. The incidents included 17 orders, 58 families, and 190 non-raptor bird species. Nineteen anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant rodenticide active ingredients were associated with the incidents. The number of incidents and species detected were compared by surveillance method. An incident was considered to have been reported through passive surveillance if it was voluntarily reported to the authorities whereas the report of an incident found through field work that was conducted with the objective of documenting adverse effects on birds was determined to be from active surveillance. More incidents were reported from passive surveillance than with active surveillance but a significantly greater number of species were detected in proportion to the number of incidents found through active surveillance than with passive surveillance (z = 7.61, p < 0.01). Results suggest that reliance on only one surveillance method can underestimate the number of incidents that have occurred and the number of species that are affected. Although rodenticides are used worldwide, incident records were found from only 15 countries. Therefore, awareness of the breadth of species diversity of non-raptor bird poisonings from rodenticides may increase incident reportings and can strengthen the predictions of harm characterized by risk assessments. © 2017",Vyas Nimish B.,U.S·Geological Survey\Patuxent Wildlife Research Center\United States,-,Anticoagulant rodenticide; Non-anticoagulant rodenticide; Non-target species; Surveillance method

Volatile fatty acids (VFA) were 1.2 times higher in the spiked digesters and significantly different (p = 0.05) from the control conditions. Specifically, isovaleric acid concentration was 2 times lower in the control digester compared to the spiked digesters, whereas hydrogen sulfide was 2 times lower in the ENPs spiked digester indicating inhibitory effect on sulfate reducing microorganisms. Based on the ether-linked isoprenoids concentration, the total abundance of methanogens was 1.4 times lower in the ENPs spiked digester than in the control and metal salt spiked digesters. Pyrosequencing indicated 80% decrease in abundance and diversity of methanogens in ENPs spiked digester compared to the control digester. Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina barkeri were identified as nano-tolerant as their relative abundance increased by a factor of 6 and 11, respectively, compared to the other digesters. The results further provide compelling evidence on the resilience of Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and the Trojan horse-like effect of ENPs which offered a competitive advantage to some organisms while reducing microbial abundance and diversity. © 2017 The Authors",Eduok Samuel; Ferguson Robert; Jefferson Bruce; Villa Raffaella; Coulon Frédéric,Cranfield University\School of Water\United Kingdom; Department of Microbiology\University of Uyo\Nigeria; Department of Biological Sciences\University of Essex\United Kingdom,-,Anaerobic digestion; Biosolids; Engineered nanoparticles; Inhibitory effect; Nano-tolerant Archaea

Irrespective of the concentration of BSA: the addition of BSA did enhance the sorption capacity of BDE-47 to soils, due to generation of more sorption sites. For SA, it increased the sorption capacity of BDE-47 at low BDE-47 concentrations, while the presence of SA negatively affected sorption of BDE-47 at high BDE-47 concentrations. The partition effect dominates the sorption of BDE-47 to soils, but after adding either BSA or SA, the sorption of BDE-47 to soils is dominated by surface sorption. Film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion were also involved in the sorption process with and without BSA or SA, with the latter being the rate-limiting step. The heterogeneous surface and nonlinear sorption behavior of BDE-47 to soils increased in the presence of either BSA or SA. The FTIR spectra indicated that the aromatic C[dbnd]C, H-bonds and OH groups may be involved in the sorption process. Therefore, BSA enhanced the retention of BDE-47 to soil, while SA's influence on BDE-47 sorption to soil depended on the concentration of BDE-47. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Guangxia; Bian Yongrong; Jia Mingyun; Boughner Lisa A.; Gu Chenggang; Song Yang; Sheng Hongjie; Zhao Wei; Jiang Xin; Wang Fang,Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation\Institute of Soil Science\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Department of Plant\Soil and Microbial Sciences\United States; School of Environment Science and Engineering\Nanjing Tech University\China,-,Bovine serum albumin; Partition effect; Persistent organic pollutant; Sodium alginate; Surface sorption
381.html,Nitrogen losses and greenhouse gas emissions under different N and water management in a subtropical double-season rice cropping system,"Nitrogen non-point pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are major challenges in rice production. This study examined options for both economic and environmental sustainability through optimizing water and N management. Field experiments were conducted to examine the crop yields, N use efficiency (NUE), greenhouse gas emissions, N losses under different N and water management. There were four treatments: zero N input with farmer's water management (N0), farmer's N and water management (FP), optimized N management with farmer's water management (OPTN) and optimized N management with alternate wetting and drying irrigation (OPTN+ AWD). Grain yields in OPTNand OPTN+ AWD treatments increased by 13.0–17.3% compared with FP. Ammonia volatilization (AV) was the primary pathway for N loss for all treatments and accounted for over 50% of the total losses. N losses mainly occurred before mid-tillering. N losses through AV, leaching and surface runoff in OPTNwere reduced by 18.9–51.6% compared with FP. OPTN+ AWD further reduced N losses from surface runoff and leaching by 39.1% and 6.2% in early rice season, and by 46.7% and 23.5% in late rice season, respectively, compared with OPTN. The CH4emissions in OPTN+ AWD were 20.4–45.4% lower than in OPTNand FP. Total global warming potential of CH4and N2O was the lowest in OPTN+ AWD. On-farm comparison confirmed that N loss through runoff in OPTN+ AWD was reduced by over 40% as compared with FP. OPTNand OPTN+ AWD significantly increased grain yield by 6.7–13.9%. These results indicated that optimizing water and N management can be a simple and effective approach for enhancing yield with reduced environmental footprints. © 2017",Liang Kaiming; Zhong Xuhua; Huang Nongrong; Lampayan Rubenito M.; Liu Yanzhuo; Pan Junfeng; Peng Bilin; Hu Xiangyu; Fu Youqiang,The Rice Research Institute of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangdong Key Laboratory of New Technology for Rice Breeding\Guangzhou\China; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)\DAPO Box 7777\Philippines; College of Engineering and Agro-Industrial Technology\University of the Philippines Los Banos\Philippines,-,Methane emission; Nitrogen losses; Nitrous oxide emission; South China

Planted systems had higher ibuprofen removal rates (29%–99%) than in the unplanted ones (15%–85%) in all designs. The use of forced aeration improved ibuprofen removal only in the unplanted mesocosms. In general, ibuprofen removal followed an area-based first-order removal kinetics model with removal rate coefficients (kA) varying between 3 and 35 cm/d. The ibuprofen removal was mainly attributed to microbial degradation by the fixed bed biofilm, but plant uptake and degradation within plant tissues also occurred. The ibuprofen removal was positively correlated with the oxygen concentration in the water and the removal of nutrients, indicating that degradation may be due to co-metabolisation processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Liang; Lv Tao; Zhang Yang; Stein Otto R.; Arias Carlos A.; Brix Hans; Carvalho Pedro N.,Department of Bioscience\Aarhus University\Denmark; College of Life Science\South China Normal University\China; Department of Civil Engineering and Center for Biofilm Engineering\Montana State University\United States,-,Constructed wetlands; Contaminants of emerging concern; Intensified systems; Kinetics; Pharmaceuticals; Removal processes
383.html,Seasonal variation in water uptake patterns of three plant species based on stable isotopes in the semi-arid Loess Plateau,"Water is a limiting factor and significant driving force for ecosystem processes in arid and semi-arid areas. Knowledge of plant water uptake pattern is indispensable for understanding soil–plant interactions and species coexistence. The ‘Grain for Green’ project that started in 1999 in the Loess Plateau of China has led to large scale vegetation change. However, little is known about the water uptake patterns of the main plant species that inhabit in this region. In this study, the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of three representative plant species, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii and Vitex negundo, that are widely distributed in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau, were identified by using dual stable isotopes of δ2H and δ18O in plant and soil water coupled with a Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR. The soil water at the 0–120 cm depth contributed 79.54 ± 6.05% and 79.94 ± 8.81% of the total water uptake of S. bungeana and A. gmelinii, respectively, in the growing season. The 0–40 cm soil contributed the most water in July (74.20 ± 15.20%), and the largest proportion of water (33.10 ± 15.20%) was derived from 120–300 cm soils in August for A. gmelinii. However, V. negundo obtained water predominantly from surface soil horizons (0–40 cm) and then switched to deep soil layers (120–300 cm) as the season progressed. This suggested that V. negundo has a greater degree of ecological plasticity as it could explore water sources from deeper soils as the water stress increased. This capacity can mainly be attributed to its functionally dimorphic root system. V. negundo may have a competitive advantage when encountering short-term drought. The ecological plasticity of plant water use needs to be considered in plant species selection and ecological management and restoration of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the Loess Plateau. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Jian; Fu Bojie; Lu Nan; Zhang Li,State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change\Institute of Botany\China,-,Dual stable isotopes; Loess Plateau; MixSIAR; Root distribution; Water uptake pattern
384.html,Biodeterioration of marble in an underwater environment,"This study examines the deterioration of geomaterials used throughout history that today may be found lying on the ocean floor. Submerged archaeological sites including cargoes from shipwrecks or ancient city ruins have been a topic of interest from a perspective of in situ musealization, as a way of making underwater cultural heritage accessible to the public. In an experimental study conducted at an underwater archaeological site in the Bay of Cádiz (SW Spain), we subjected two types of marble (Carrara and Macael) to three conditions to which submerged archaeological objects are often exposed: full exposure to the water column, natural processes of burial and unearthing, or permanent burial. After an 18-month study period, the factor found to mostly affect these materials was their biological colonization. This factor was assessed by estimating total surface biocover and the rate of surface biocolonization, and also through the identification of skeletons and associated alteration forms by light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biofouling and bioerosion were the main causes of biodeterioration and dependent on the position of the marble specimens in the seawater. The response of both materials was similar, though dolomite crystals in the Carrara marble acted as a protective barrier against actively penetrating microorganisms. These investigations have allowed the study of tracers left by epilithic encrusting organisms and endolithic bioeroders on marbles intentionally exposed to seawater, providing new insights to the understanding of the biodeterioration processes occurring in cultural heritage stones, with significant implications when they are part of underwater archaeological remains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cámara Beatriz; de Buergo Mónica Álvarez; Bethencourt Manuel; Fernández-Montblanc Tomás; La Russa Mauro F.; Ricca Michela; Fort Rafael,Dept. of Geomaterials\Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO\Spain; Dept. of Material Science\Metallurgical Engineering and Inorganic Chemistry\Spain; Dept. of Biology\Ecology and Earth Sciences (DiBEST)\Italy,-,Bioerosion; Biofouling; Carrara; Decay; Macael; Submerged archeology
385.html,Stability of cognitive development during the first five years of life in relation to heavy metal concentrations in umbilical cord blood: Mothers' and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) birth cohort study,"The objective of this study was to investigate stability of cognitive development during the first five years of life in relation to heavy metal concentrations in umbilical cord blood in Korean children. This research is part of the Mothers' and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) study, a multi-center prospective birth cohort study of pregnant women in Korea who were recruited from 2006 to 2010. We analyzed the complete follow-up data of children who were 5 years-old in 2016. We measured lead, mercury, and cadmium levels in the umbilical cord blood of 251 children, and analyzed them, for whom neurodevelopmental data were available. We determined stability of cognitive development scores using three methods. First, we used partial correlation analyses to examine the stability of cognitive development at each measurement time. Second, we used Cramer's V to investigate the magnitude and direction of changes in cognitive development scores at each follow-up period among three groups (high, medium, and low scores). The results showed that cognitive development scores measured at the closest times had the strongest correlations, and the stability of cognitive development scores increased with age, from 6 to 60 months. Groups at the extreme ends of cognitive development (high or low scores) had more stable scores, and this tendency was also stronger in infants > 24 months-old. The stability of cognitive development was unrelated to the umbilical cord level of heavy metals, based on analysis with Fisher's transformation. In conclusion, the present study showed that the cognitive development scores in a cohort of infants (6 to 60 months-old) were stable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lee Hyungmin; Park Hyewon; Ha Eunhee; Hong Yun-Chul; Ha Mina; Park Hyesook; Kim Bung-Nyun; Lee Soo-Jeong; Lee Kyung Yeon; Kim Ja Hyeong; Jeong Kyoung Sook; Kim Yangho,Department of Child and Family Welfare\Hankyong National University\South Korea; Department of Child and Family Welfare\University of Ulsan\South Korea; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine\Ewha Medical Research Center\South Korea; Institute of Environmental Medicine\Medical Research Center\South Korea,-,Cadmium; Child; Cord blood; Intelligence; Lead; Mercury; Stability
386.html,"Aging impacts of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on furfural production residue-derived biochars: Porosity, functional properties, and inorganic minerals","The aging of biochar by low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), which are typical root-derived exudates, is not well understood. Three LMWOAs (ethanoic, malic, and citric acids) were employed to investigate their aging impacts on the biochars from furfural production residues at 300–600 °C (BC300–600). The LMWOAs created abundant macropores in BC300, whereas they significantly increased the mesoporosity and surface area of BC600 by 13.5–27.0% and 44.6–61.5%, respectively. After LMWOA aging, the content of C and H of the biochars increased from 51.3–60.2% and 1.87–3.45% to 56.8–69.9% and 2.06–4.45%, respectively, but the O content decreased from 13.8–24.8% to 7.82–19.4% (except BC300). For carbon fraction in the biochars, the LMWOAs barely altered the bulk and surface functional properties during short-term aging. The LMWOAs facilitated the dissolution of minerals (e.g., K2Mg(PO3)4, AlPO4, and Pb2P2O7) and correspondingly promoted the release of not only plant nutrients (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, PO43 −, and SO42–) but also toxic metals (Al3+and Pb2+). This research provided systematic insights on the responses of biochar properties to LMWOAs and presented direct evidence for acid activation of inorganic minerals in the biochars by LMWOAs, which could enhance the understanding of environmental behaviors of biochars in rhizosphere soils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Guocheng; Chen Lei; Jiang Zhixiang; Zheng Hao; Dai Yanhui; Luo Xianxiang; Wang Zhenyu,Institute of Coastal Environmental Pollution Control\Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science and Ecology\China; College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Qingdao University\China; Institute of Environmental Processes and Pollution Control\School of Environmental and Civil Engineering\China; Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science\Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology\China,-,Biochar; Functional groups; Inorganic minerals; Low molecular weight organic acids; Porosity
387.html,Prenatal low-level phenol exposures and birth outcomes in China,"Phenolic compounds are among the endocrine disruptors which are widely used in daily life products. Studies in laboratory animals showed reproductive and developmental effects. In spite of widespread exposure to phenols, only few studies examined their effects on human development. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between antenatal phenol exposure and birth outcomes in a Chinese obstetric population. Four hundred ninety-six mother-infant pairs recruited from the Laizhou Wan prospective birth cohort in northern China between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. We measured two phenol metabolites in maternal urine at delivery and examined their associations with birth outcomes including birth weight, crown–heel length, head circumference, gestational age, and ponderal index. Median levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) in urine were 1.07 and 0.50 μg/g creatinine, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a 10-fold increase in BPA levels was associated with a 0.63 cm [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 to 1.01] increase in birth length among boys, but not among girls. No associations were found between TCS levels and any birth outcomes. The positive association of prenatal low-level BPA exposures with anthropometric measures observed among boys, suggests gender differences in the response to antenatal phenol exposure. Given the variability in urinary phenol levels reported during pregnancy, our findings based on levels of the target biomarkers in a single urine sample need to be confirmed in additional studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ding Guodong; Wang Caifeng; Vinturache Angela; Zhao Shasha; Pan Rui; Han Wenchao; Chen Limei; Wang Weiye; Yuan Tao; Gao Yu; Tian Ying,MOE and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Children's Environmental Health\Xinhua Hospital\China; Department of Pediatrics\Shanghai East Hospital\China; Department of Environmental Health\School of Public Health\China; School of Nursing\Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine\China,-,Birth outcomes; Bisphenol A; China; Phenols; Triclosan
388.html,"Response of soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activities to long-term reclamation of coastal saline soil, Eastern China","Soil enzyme activity during different years of reclamation and land use patterns could indicate changes in soil quality. The objective of this research is to explore the dynamics of 5 soil enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, amylase, urease, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase) involved in C, N, and P cycling and their responses to changes in soil physicochemical properties resulting from long-term reclamation of coastal saline soil. Soil samples from a total of 55 sites were collected from a coastal reclamation area with different years of reclamation (0, 7, 32, 40, 63a) in this study. The results showed that both long-term reclamation and land use patterns have significant effects on soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activities. Compared with the bare flat, soil water content, soil bulk density, pH and electrical conductivity showed a decreasing trend after reclamation, whereas soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus tended to increase. Dehydrogenase, amylase and acid phosphatase activities initially increased and then decreased with increasing years of reclamation, whereas urease and alkaline phosphatase activities were characterized by an increase-decrease-increase trend. Moreover, urease, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities exhibited significant differences between coastal saline soil with 63 years of reclamation and bare flat, whereas dehydrogenase and amylase activities remained unchanged. Aquaculture ponds showed higher soil water content, pH and EC but lower soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus than rapeseed, broad bean and wheat fields. Rapeseed, broad bean and wheat fields displayed higher urease and alkaline phosphatase activities and lower dehydrogenase, amylase and acid phosphatase activities compared with aquaculture ponds. Redundancy analysis revealed that the soil physicochemical properties explained 74.5% of the variation in soil enzyme activities and that an obvious relationship existed between soil nutrients and soil enzyme activities. These results will assist governmental evaluation of the quality of reclaimed coastal soil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xie Xuefeng; Pu Lijie; Wang Qiqi; Zhu Ming; Xu Yan; Zhang Meng,School of Geographic and Oceanographic Sciences\Nanjing University\China,-,Coastal saline soil; Land reclamation; Redundancy analysis; Soil enzyme
389.html,"River sequesters atmospheric carbon and limits the CO2degassing in karst area, southwest China","CO2fluxes across water-air interfaces of river systems play important roles in regulating the regional and global carbon cycle. However, great uncertainty remains as to the contribution of these inland water bodies to the global carbon budget. Part of the uncertainty stems from limited understanding of the CO2fluxes at diurnal and seasonal frequencies caused by aquatic metabolism. Here, we measured surface water characteristics (temperature, pH, and DO, DIC, Ca2 +concentrations) and CO2fluxes across the air-water interface at two transects of Guijiang River, southwest China to assess the seasonal and diurnal dynamics of fluvial carbon cycling and its potential role in regional and global carbon budgets. The two transects had differing bedrock; DM transect is underlain by carbonate and detrital rock and PY is underlain by pure carbonate. Our results show that the river water both degasses CO2to and absorbs CO2from the atmosphere in both summer and winter, but the degassing and absorption varied between the two transects. Further, CO2fluxes evolve through diurnal cycles. At DM, the river evaded CO2from early morning through noon and absorbed CO2from afternoon through early morning. At PY in summer, the CO2evasion decreased during the daytime and increased at night while in winter at night, CO2uptake increased in the morning and decreased in the afternoon but remained relatively stable at night. Although the river is a net source of carbon to the atmosphere (~ 15 mM m− 2day− 1), the evasion rate is the smallest of all reported world's inland water bodies reflecting sequestration of atmospheric carbon through the carbonate dissolution and high primary productivity. These results emphasize the need of seasonal and diurnal monitoring of CO2fluxes across water-air interface, particularly in highly productive rivers, to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine CO2emission. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Tao; Li Jianhong; Pu Junbing; Martin Jonathan B.; Khadka Mitra B.; Wu Feihong; Li Li; Jiang Feng; Huang Siyu; Yuan Daoxian,Key Laboratory of Karst Dynamics\MLR & Guangxi\China; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Karst Environment\School of Geography Sciences\China; Department of Geological Sciences\University of Florida\United States; College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Guilin University of Technology\China,-,CO2uptake; Diel cycle; Karst river; Southwest China; Water-air interface

Since the 1980s, numerous mitigation and land rehabilitation measures have been implemented by local and national authorities to reduce these impacts, are often poorly effective. As underlying reason may be that controlling relationships between climate and ecohydrology at medium-sized catchments (10–10,000 km2) of semi-arid highlands are not well known. We investigated trends and relationships in precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and net primary productivity (NPP). The results were mixed, with both significant increasing and decreasing trends for temperature and streamflow. Precipitation time series did not show a significant trend for the majority of stations, both over the years and over each season, except for a few stations. A time series indicated a significant abrupt increase of NPP in annual, seasonal and monthly timescale. Cross-correlation and regression analysis indicate precipitation and maximum temperature were the dominant climatic variables in the Geba catchment for streamflow and NPP. In view of these results, also land use and land cover change over the past three decades was analysed as a possible factor of importance, as human intervention, may affect streamflow and NPP. Factors that mainly correlate with streamflow and NPP are precipitation and maximum temperature. Important interventions that appear beneficial for these responses are construction of micro-dams, soil and water conservation and ecological restoration measures. The awareness that interactions can be quite different in semi-arid and semi-humid regions, as well as in upstream and downstream areas, should be reflected in management aimed at sustainable water and land resources use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tesfaye Samuale; Birhane Emiru; Leijnse Toon,Soil Physics and Land Management Group\Wageningen University\Netherlands; Department of Land Resources Management and Environmental Protection\Mekelle University\Ethiopia; Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management\Norwegian University of Life Sciences\Norway; School of Chemistry\Monash University\Australia,-,Ecosystem model; Land use; Precipitation; Primary productivity; Semi-arid; Streamflow
391.html,Surface complexation modeling of Cu(II) sorption to montmorillonite–bacteria composites,"Surface complexation modeling, isothermal titration calorimetry, and batch adsorption were employed to characterize the adsorption of Cu onto montmorillonite, Pseudomonas putida X4, and their composites at mass ratios of 2:1, 6:1, and 12:1, respectively. Different enthalpy values were found for Cu adsorption to permanent (− 6.43 kJ/mol) and variable charge sites (8.51 kJ/mol) on montmorillonite. The component additivity (CA) method was used to predict the adsorption of Cu on the composites by combining end member models for montmorillonite and P. putida. A reduced adsorption was observed at pH < 5.5 due to physical blocking between montmorillonite and P. putida. By contrast, the enhanced binding at high pH levels was ascribed to the formation of bridging structures among the clay mineral–Cu–bacteria complexes. These deviations in the CA method were corrected by adding reactions of > RCOOH…XNa and > RCOO[sbnd]CuOH[sbnd]XNa. The increased adsorption of the composites confirmed the decrease of permanent negative charge sites and the formation of ternary complexes. The results help elucidate the effect of Cu adsorption onto clay minerals–bacteria composites. The newly developed “CA–site masking–bridging” model can be used to predict Cu speciation in systems in which the active interaction of bacteria and clay minerals occurs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Qu Chengcheng; Ma Mingkai; Chen Wenli; Cai Peng; Huang Qiaoyun,State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology\Huazhong Agricultural University\China; Key Laboratory of Arable Land Conservation (Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River)\Ministry of Agriculture\China,-,Bridging; Copper adsorption; Montmorillonite; Pseudomonas putida; Site masking; Surface complexation model

To investigate the degree of loss risk and forms of soil P in calcic cinnamon soil, the P fraction activities in soils were analysed using chemical methods, combined with an in situ field experiment. Seven treatments were set in this study, including control (unfertilized), no P fertilizer (No-P), mineral P fertilizer (Min-P), low (L-Man) and high (H-Man) quantities of pig manure, Min-P + L-Man, and Min-P + H-Man. The results showed that manure fertilizer could not only significantly increase maize yield but could also enhance the accumulation of soil P in organic and inorganic forms. After 23 years of repeated fertilization, the soil Olsen-P contents respectively showed 64.7-, 43.7- and 31.9-fold increases in the Min-P + H-Man, Min-P + L-Man and H-Man treatments, while the soil Olsen-P in Min-P treatment only increased 23.7-fold. The soil Olsen-P thresholds ranged from 22.59 to 32.48 mg kg− 1in calcic cinnamon soil to maintain a higher maize yield as well as a lower risk of P loss. Therefore, long-term excessive manure application could obviously raise the content of soil Olsen-P and increase the risk of P loss in calcic cinnamon soil. © 2017",Yang Yanju; Zhang Haipeng; Qian Xiaoqing; Duan Jiannan; Wang Gailan,College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Yangzhou University\China; School of Agricultural Resources and Environment\Hunan Agriculture University\China,-,Olsen-P; Organic phosphorus; Phosphorus loss; Phosphorus threshold range; Soil phosphorus forms

Beneficial use of these types of waste is a good alternative to landfilling; however, there are genuine concerns about possible soil and groundwater contamination by pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study assessed the potential risks associated with beneficial use of roadway and stormwater system residuals collected from 14 cities across the state of Florida, USA. Total and leachable concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in the residual samples were measured and compared to appropriate risk-based regulatory threshold values. The bioaccessibility of the PAHs found in the waste streams was also determined using in vitro gastrointestinal leaching test. Of the PAHs studied, benzo [a] pyrene measured concentrations were above appropriate risk-based regulatory threshold values for soil and groundwater, while all other detected PAHs measured concentrations were below. Benzo [a] pyrene concentration (mg/kg) in street sweepings was 1.2 times higher than residential threshold values and 6 times lower than industrial threshold values.

Results indicate that there exist many hierarchical pores consisting of the single carbon sheet with ultrathin nature, owing to the template role of molten salt mixtures at high temperature. Such superior structure can bring about desired performance of adsorption capacity of 82.8 mg/g and quick adsorption rate of 1.43 L/(g h) with an initial concentration of 35 mg/L at 25 °C. Langmuir and Freundlich models are adopted to interpret the adsorption behavior of atrazine and modified Freundlich and intraparticle diffusion (IPD) models are employed to characterize the dynamics of adsorption. Furthermore, nitrogen-functionalization biochars via molten salt synthesis should be further developed as a one-pot methodology to produce N-doped carbons, opening up a feasible approach for resource utilization of crop straws and other biomass wastes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yang Fan; Sun Lili; Xie Weiling; Jiang Qun; Gao Yan; Zhang Wei; Zhang Ying,School of Resource and Environment\Northeast Agricultural University\China; College of Science\Northeast Agticultural University\China,-,Adsorption; Atrazine; Carbon sheets; Nitrogen-functionalized; Wheat straw
395.html,Quantifying deforestation and forest degradation with thermal response,"Deforestation and forest degradation cause the deterioration of resources and ecosystem services. However, there are still no operational indicators to measure forest status, especially for forest degradation. In the present study, we analysed the thermal response number (TRN, calculated by daily total net radiation divided by daily temperature range) of 163 sites including mature forest, disturbed forest, planted forest, shrubland, grassland, savanna vegetation and cropland. TRN generally increased with latitude, however the regression of TRN against latitude differed among vegetation types. Mature forests are superior as thermal buffers, and had significantly higher TRN than disturbed and planted forests. There was a clear boundary between TRN of forest and non-forest vegetation (i.e. grassland and savanna) with the exception of shrubland, whose TRN overlapped with that of forest vegetation. We propose to use the TRN of local mature forest as the optimal TRN (TRNopt). A forest with lower than 75% of TRNoptwas identified as subjected to significant disturbance, and forests with 66% of TRNoptwas the threshold for deforestation within the absolute latitude from 30° to 55°. Our results emphasized the irreplaceable thermal buffer capacity of mature forest. TRN can be used for early warning of deforestation and degradation risk. It is therefore a valuable tool in the effort to protect forests and prevent deforestation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lin Hua; Chen Yajun; Song Qinghai; Fu Peili; Cleverly James; Magliulo Vincenzo; Law Beverly E.; Gough Christopher M.; Hörtnagl Lukas; Di Gennaro Filippo; Matteucci Giorgio; Montagnani Leonardo,Key Laboratory of Tropical Forest Ecology\Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden\China; Terrestrial Ecohydrology Research Group\School of Life Sciences\Australia; CNR-ISAFOM\Via Patacca\Italy; Forest Ecosystems & Society\Oregon State University\United States,-,Disturbance; Reforestation; Succession; Surface temperature; Temperature stability

However, the possibility of CO2leakage from reservoirs and pipelines exists, and such leakage could negatively affect organisms in the soil environment. Therefore, to determine the impacts of geological CO2leakage on plant and soil processes, we conducted a greenhouse study in which plants and soils were exposed to high levels of soil CO2. Cabbage, which has been reported to be vulnerable to high soil CO2, was grown under BI (no injection), NI (99.99% N2injection), and CI (99.99% CO2injection). Mean soil CO2concentration for CI was 66.8–76.9% and the mean O2concentrations in NI and CI were 6.6–12.7%, which could be observed in the CO2leaked soil from the pipelines connected to the CCS sites. The soil N2O emission was increased by 286% in the CI, where NO3−-N concentration was 160% higher compared to that in the control. This indicates that higher N2O emission from CO2leakage could be due to enhanced nitrification process. Higher NO3−-N content in soil was related to inhibited plant metabolism. In the CI treatment, chlorophyll content decreased and chlorosis appeared after 8th day of injection. Due to the inhibited root growth, leaf water and nitrogen contents were consistently lowered by 15% under CI treatment. Our results imply that N2O emission could be increased by the secondary effects of CO2leakage on plant metabolism. Hence, monitoring the environmental changes in rhizosphere would be very useful for impact assessment of CCS technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kim You Jin; He Wenmei; Ko Daegeun; Chung Haegeun; Yoo Gayoung,Department of Applied Environmental Science\Kyung Hee University\South Korea; Department of Environmental Engineering\Konkuk University\South Korea; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering\Kyung Hee University\South Korea,-,Cabbage; CCS; CO2leakage; High soil CO2; Nitrification; Soil N2O emission
398.html,"Taxonomy- or trait-based ecological assessment for tropical rivers? Case study on benthic diatoms in Mayotte island (France, Indian Ocean)","Diatom-based ecological quality assessment methods have been implemented and used regularly in the Water Framework Directive. These indices use the species' abundance profiles along a specific environmental gradient, which they aim to assess. However, this approach has several problematic issues including the unstable and fast-changing diatom taxonomy. The use of traits can be a solution if their responses to the environmental pressure are well-defined. Here, we developed taxonomy-based and trait-based diatom assemblage indices to assess the ecological status of riverine sites on a tropical island. The two indices are based on two sub-indices that measure the diatom assemblage response to a nutrient and organic matter/turbidity gradient. Both taxonomy- and trait-based indices correlated significantly with the selected environmental gradients of the test database, which was not used during index development. We showed that traits could be used for quality assessment of the Mayotte rivers and require much less effort than taxonomy-based indices. There were differences between the two types of indices, which are discussed in this paper. As a perspective for further studies, tests of trait-based indices among different eco-regions would be challenging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tapolczai Kálmán; Bouchez Agnès; Stenger-Kovács Csilla; Padisák Judit; Rimet Frédéric,UMR CARRTEL\INRA\France; Department of Limnology\University of Pannonia\Hungary; MTA-PE Limnoecology Research Group\Egyetem u. 10\Hungary,-,Bacillariophyta; Biomonitoring; Morphological traits; Quality index; Water Framework Directive
399.html,Soil bacterial community response to vegetation succession after fencing in the grassland of China,"Natural succession is an important process in terrestrial system, playing an important role in enhancing soil quality and plant diversity. Soil bacteria is the linkage between soil and plant, has an important role in aboveground community dynamics and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems, driving the decomposition of soil organic matter and plant litter. However, the role of soil bacteria in the secondary succession has not been well understood, particularly in the degraded soil of Loess Plateau. In this study, we investigated soil nutrients and soil bacterial community during the secondary succession after a long-term fencing in the grassland, in the Yuwu Mountain, northwest China. The chronosequence included 1 year, 12 years, 20 years and 30 years. The soil bacterial community composition was determined by the Illumina HiSeq sequencing method. The data showed that soil bacterial diversity had no significant changes along the chronosequence, but soil bacterial community compositions significantly changed. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the main phyla in all the samples across succession. With the accumulation of soil organic matter and nutrients, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased, whereas Proteobacteria increased. These shifts may be caused by the increase of the available nutrients across the secondary succession. In the younger sites, soils were dominated by oligotrophic groups, whereas soil in the late-succession site were dominated by copiotrophic groups, indicating the dependence of soil bacterial community composition on the contents of soil available nutrients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zeng Quanchao; An Shaoshan; Liu Yang,College of Natural Resources and Environment\Northwest A&F University\China; State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau\Northwest A&F University\China,-,Available nutrients; HiSeq prosequencing; Soil bacteria; Vegetation succession; Yunwu Mountain

It predicts that contexts play an exclusively decisive role in meaning processing, whereas the latter holds that the inference of literal meaning generally goes through, unless it is subsequently defaulted or cancelled by the context it is associated with. The Standardization Model, which we added to our experiments, highlights that implicatures are figured out from standardized forms typically based on the mutual background belief and speaker’s intention. We tested whether Chinese people’s processing of the gradable adjective scale [removed] conformed more to the Context-driven Model, the Default Model, or the Standardization Model. The results demonstrated that the Standardization Model is the most acceptable among the three.

400.html,Influence of rainfall duration and intensity on particulate matter removal from plant leaves,"Rainfall influences removal of airborne particulate matter (PM) from leaf surfaces through a process called wash off resulting in throughfall that carries PM to the ground. The present study examined the effects of rainfall characteristics on PM wash-off mass and rate from the foliage of four broadleaf species, to investigate retention of PM pollution. In a controlled rainfall simulation experiment, rainfall intensity was set to 15, 30, and 50 mm h− 1, and sampling intervals for the three rainfall intensities were divided into 10, 5, and 3 min, respectively. Of the plants examined, the evergreen shrub Euonymus japonicus had the greatest surface PM accumulation before rainfall (165 μg cm− 2), maximum wash-off during the first 2.5 mm of rain (30 μg cm− 2), and maximum surface PM retention after rainfall (24 μg cm− 2). Fitting observations with the Box Lucas regression model, cumulative PM wash-off rates increased with cumulative rainfall amount, until the curves tended to become steady after rain exceeded 12.5 mm. Wash off removed 51 to 70% of surface PM accumulation. As rainfall intensity increased, the duration of PM wash-off decreased, and wash-off rates were highest during the first rainfall interval. However, there was no significant difference between PM wash-off rates for rainfall intensities of 30 and 50 mm h− 1in each rainfall interval. In addition, rain did not remove all PM completely, and PM retention following rainfall differed with rainfall intensity, except for Populus tomentosa. © 2017",Xu Xiaowu; Zhang Zhenming; Bao Le; Mo Li; Yu Xinxiao; Fan Dengxing; Lun Xiaoxiu,Beijing Laboratory of Urban and Rural Ecological Environment\Beijing Forestry University\China; China-ASEAN Environmental Cooperation Center\No. 5 Houyingfang Hutong\China,-,Air pollution; Leaf surface; Particulates; PM removal; Simulated rainfall

Analyses were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The polar organic compounds analysed by UHPLC-MS-MS were 1H-benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazoles, carbamazepine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethox-azole, 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid), metolachlor, cybutryne (irgarol), terbutryn, DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), and several perfluoroalkyl acids (C6–C9; C8= perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)) and perfluorooctansulfonic acid (PFOS). In addition, several organophosphorus flame retardants were analysed by GC-MS. The most relevant compounds identified in the 71 water samples, in terms of highest median and maximum concentrations, were 1H-benzotriazole, tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TCPP), methylbenzotriazoles, carbama-zepine and its metabolite, DEET, sulfamethoxazole, tris(isobutyl)phosphate (TiBP), tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), PFOA, PFOS and diclofenac. The concentrations of these compounds in the samples were generally below the environmental quality standard (EQS) threshold values, with the exception of PFOS, the concentration of which exceeded the annual average water EQS limit of 0.65 ng/L along the whole river, and also exceeded the fish biota EQS of 9.1 μg/kg. In addition, the proposed EQS for diclofenac, of 0.1 μg/L, was exceeded in the Arges River in Romania (255 ng/L). © 2017 The Author(s)",Loos Robert; Tavazzi Simona; Mariani Giulio; Suurkuusk Gert; Paracchini Bruno; Umlauf Gunther,European Commission\Joint Research Centre (JRC)\Italy,-,Danube River; Emerging organic contaminants; GC-MS; UHPLC-MS-MS; Water Framework Directive; Water monitoring
402.html,Rethinking aqueous phase diffusion related isotope fractionation: Contrasting theoretical effects with observations at the field scale,"Aqueous phase diffusion-related isotope fractionation (DRIF) was investigated through modelling to determine under what subsurface conditions carbon isotope DRIF effects would be observable using typical sampling approaches. A dispersive enrichment factor was defined based on heavy and light isotopologue dispersion coefficients. For a given ratio of source concentration (C0) to method detection limit (MDL), the maximum DRIF in a system increased linearly with transverse dispersive enrichment factor. Using this linear relationship, the critical dispersion enrichment factor for which DRIF would not be observable was quantified. Dispersive enrichment factors for various contaminants (benzene, toluene, chlorinated compounds) were estimated using field scale transverse dispersion coefficients upscaled from compound specific or non-compound specific local scale dispersivity. All predicted dispersive enrichment factors with non-compound specific dispersivity are smaller than critical values even for high C0/MDL ratios (e.g. 25,000), indicating DRIF would generally not be observable in systems where soil dispersivity is non-compound specific. To date, this finding has not been clearly articulated in the DRIF literature. While the calculated dispersive enrichment factors for some compounds with compound specific transverse dispersivity exceeded the critical values at which DRIF might become significant, the zones in which DRIF could potentially be observable were limited to bands below 0.5 m wide on lateral plume edges. In aquifer-aquitard systems, DRIF was theoretically detectable only in thin aquifers (e.g. 0.5 m) bounded by thick (e.g. meters) aquitards. DRIF due to back diffusion from aquitards would not be observable regardless of aquifer thickness. Simulations addressing the mixing effect in wells demonstrated that DRIF effects would be difficult to identify in the field without a sampling strategy (including smaller than industry norm well screen lengths, and fine sampling scales) expressly targeted towards that goal. The results of this study help identify what the required characteristics of such a field strategy might be. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Shu; Sherwood Lollar Barbara; Sleep Brent E.,Civil Engineering Department\University of Toronto\Canada; Earth Sciences Department\University of Toronto\Canada,-,-
403.html,Can brook trout survive climate change in large rivers? If it rains,"We provide an assessment of thermal characteristics and climate change vulnerability for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) habitats in the upper Shavers Fork sub-watershed, West Virginia. Spatial and temporal (2001–2015) variability in observed summer (6/1–8/31) stream temperatures was quantified in 23 (9 tributary, 14 main-stem) reaches. We developed a mixed effects model to predict site-specific mean daily stream temperature from air temperature and discharge and coupled this model with a hydrologic model to predict future (2016–2100) changes in stream temperature under low (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emissions scenarios. Observed mean daily stream temperature exceeded the 21 °C brook trout physiological threshold in all but one main-stem site, and 3 sites exceeded proposed thermal limits for either 63- and 7-day mean stream temperature. We modeled mean daily stream temperature with a high degree of certainty (R2= 0.93; RMSE = 0.76 °C). Predicted increases in mean daily stream temperature in main-stem and tributary reaches ranged from 0.2 °C (RCP 4.5) to 1.2 °C (RCP 8.5). Between 2091 and 2100, the average number of days with mean daily stream temperature > 21 °C increased within main-stem sites under the RCP 4.5 (0–1.2 days) and 8.5 (0 − 13) scenarios; however, no site is expected to exceed 63- or 7-day thermal limits. During the warmest 10 years, ≥ 5 main-stem sites exceeded the 63- or 7-day thermal tolerance limits under both climate emissions scenarios. Years with the greatest increases in stream temperature were characterized by low mean daily discharge. Main-stem reaches below major tributaries never exceed thermal limits, despite neighboring reaches having among the highest observed and predicted stream temperatures. Persistence of thermal refugia within upper Shavers Fork would enable persistence of metapopulation structure and life history processes. However, this will only be possible if projected increases in discharge are realized and offset expected increases in air temperature. © 2017 The Authors",Merriam Eric R.; Fernandez Rodrigo; Petty J.

404.html,"Litter thickness, but not root biomass, explains the average and spatial structure of soil hydraulic conductivity in secondary forests and coffee agroecosystems in Veracruz, Mexico","Secondary forests and coffee agroecosystems are considered good alternatives for conservation of a high capacity for water filtration in the soil where tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) once grew; however, it is not clear which characteristics of the vegetation modulate the field saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil (Kfs) and whether these characteristics persist in such derived systems. Here, we explore how changes in vegetation between secondary forests and coffee agroecosystems have consequences for the average value and spatial variation of litter thickness and root biomass, and whether these differences can explain the Kfsand its spatial distribution. We found that the thickest litter, greatest total biomass and thickest roots are in the secondary forest of the north of the study area. The litter is spatially structured in patches of ca. 12 m at plot scale in the secondary forest and coffee agroecosystem of the southern area. Like the Kfs, the thickness of the litter and biomass of the thick (> 2 mm), medium (1–2 mm) and fine (< 1 mm) roots are spatially distributed on a north to south gradient at landscape scale. Our linear model indicates that geographic area (north or south), land use and litter thickness explain the Kfsand its spatial distribution along this gradient. Even on inclusion of the antecedent soil moisture and percentage of clays (found to explain Kfsin a previous study), it was not possible to eliminate from the model geographic area and land use, due to their high explanatory power. However, antecedent soil moisture became redundant on inclusion of the litter layer, which had a greater explanatory power. Our modeling suggests that undiscovered differences prevail between the geographic areas and secondary forest and coffee agroecosystems (possibly related to the edaphogenesis and management practices) that determine the Kfs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Posgrado en Ciencias\Instituto de Ecología\Mexico; Red de Ecología Funcional\Instituto de Ecología\Mexico,-,Field saturated hydraulic conductivity; Land use; Local specific influence; Tropical montane cloud forest; Variography
405.html,Solar photocatalytic disinfection of agricultural pathogenic fungi (Curvularia sp.) in real urban wastewater,"The interest in developing alternative water disinfection methods that increase the access to irrigation water free of pathogens for agricultural purposes is increasing in the last decades. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been demonstrated to be very efficient for the abatement of several kind of pathogens in contaminated water. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate and compare the capability of several solar AOPs for the inactivation of resistant spores of agricultural fungi. Solar photoassisted H2O2, solar photo-Fenton at acid and near-neutral pH, and solar heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2,with and without H2O2, have been studied for the inactivation of spores of Curvularia sp., a phytopathogenic fungi worldwide found in soils and crops. Different concentrations of reagents and catalysts were evaluated at bench scale (solar vessel reactors, 200 mL) and at pilot plant scale (solar Compound Parabolic Collector-CPC reactor, 20 L) under natural solar radiation using distilled water (DW) and real secondary effluents (SE) from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Inactivation order of Curvularia sp. in distilled water was determined, i.e. TiO2/H2O2/sunlight (100/50 mg L− 1) > H2O2/sunlight (40 mg L− 1) > TiO2/sunlight (100 mg L− 1) > photo-Fenton with 5/10 mg L− 1of Fe2 +/H2O2at pH 3 and near-neutral pH. For the case of SE, at near neutral pH, the most efficient solar process was H2O2/Solar (60 mg L− 1); nevertheless, the best Curvularia sp. inactivation rate was obtained with photo-Fenton (10/20 mg L− 1of Fe2 +/H2O2) requiring a previous water adicification to pH 3, within 300 and 210 min of solar treatment, respectively. These results show the efficiency of solar AOPs as a feasible option for the inactivation of resistant pathogens in water for crops irrigation, even in the presence of organic matter (average Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC): 24 mg L− 1), and open a window for future wastewater reclamation and irrigation use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Aguas Yelitza; Hincapie Margarita; Fernández-Ibáñez Pilar; Polo-López María Inmaculada,Universidad de Sucre\School of Engineering\Colombia; Universidad de Medellin\School of Engineering\Colombia; Nanotechnology and Integrated BioEngineering Centre\School of Engineering\United Kingdom; Plataforma Solar de Almería–CIEMAT\Carretera Senés km 4\Spain,-,Curvularia sp.; Hydrogen peroxide; Photo-Fenton; Sunlight; Titanium dioxide; Wastewater reuse
406.html,Ecosystem service trade-offs and their influencing factors: A case study in the Loess Plateau of China,"Soil erosion control (SEC), carbon sequestration (CAS), and soil moisture (SMO) strongly interact in the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Since SMO has supportive effects on SEC and CAS, it can be considered as ecosystem service (ES), and there is an immediate need to coordinate the relationships among these ecosystem services (ESs) to promote the sustainability of vegetation recovery. In this study, we quantified the ESs, ES trade-offs, and the environmental factors in 151 sample plots in the Ansai watershed, and we used a redundancy analysis (RDA) to clarify the effects of environmental factors on these ESs and their trade-offs. The results were as follows: (1) the general trend in the SEC of vegetation types was Robinia pseudoacacia (CH) > native grass (NG) > small arbor (ST) > Hippophae rhamnoides (SJ) > artificial grass (AG) > Caragana korshinskii (NT) > apple orchard (GY) > crop (CP); the CAS trend was CH > SJ > NT > AG > CP > ST > GY > NG; and the SMO trend was CP > NG > GY > AG > SJ > ST > CH > NT. (2) For SEC-SMO trade-offs, the influence of vegetation type, altitude, silt and sand composition was dominant. The arrangement of NG, AG, and SJ could decrease the extent of the trade-offs. (3) For CAS-SMO trade-offs, vegetation coverage and types were the dominant factors, but the effects were not complex. The extent of these trade-offs was lowest for NT, and that for SJ was the second lowest. (4) Considering the relationships among the three ESs, SJ was the most appropriate afforestation plant. Combing the vegetation types, slope position, slope gradient, and soil properties could regulate these ES relationships. The dominant factors influencing ES trade-offs varied among the different soil layers, so we must consider the corresponding influencing factors to regulate ESs. Moreover, manual management measures were also important for coordinating the ES relationships. Our research provides a better understanding of the mechanisms influencing the relationships among ESs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Feng Qiang; Zhao Wenwu; Fu Bojie; Ding Jingyi; Wang Shuai,State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology\Faculty of Geographical Science\China; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; College of Forestry\Shanxi Agricultural University\China,-,Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services relationship; Environmental factors; Soil erosion control; Soil moisture
407.html,Simulation of targeted pollutant-mitigation-strategies to reduce nitrate and sediment hotspots in agricultural watershed,"About 50% of U.S. water pollution problems are caused by non-point source (NPS) pollution, primarily sediment and nutrients from agricultural areas, despite the widespread implementation of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs). However, the effectiveness of implementation strategies and type of BMPs at watershed scale are still not well understood. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) ecohydrological model was used to assess the effectiveness of pollutant mitigation strategies in the Raccoon River watershed (RRW) in west-central Iowa, USA. We analyzed fourteen management scenarios based on systematic combinations of five strategies: fertilizer/manure management, changing row-crop land to perennial grass, vegetative filter strips, cover crops and shallower tile drainage systems, specifically aimed at reducing nitrate and total suspended sediment yields from hotspot areas in the RRW. Moreover, we assessed implications of climate change on management practices, and the impacts of management practices on water availability, row crop yield, and total agricultural production. Our results indicate that sufficient reduction of nitrate load may require either implementation of multiple management practices (38.5% with current setup) or conversion of extensive areas into perennial grass (up to 49.7%) to meet and maintain the drinking water standard. However, climate change may undermine the effectiveness of management practices, especially late in the 21st century, cutting the reduction by up to 65% for nitrate and more for sediment loads. Further, though our approach is targeted, it resulted in a slight decrease (~ 5%) in watershed average crop yield and hence an overall reduction in total crop production, mainly due to the conversion of row-crop lands to perennial grass. Such yield reductions could be quite spatially heterogeneously distributed (0 to 40%). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Teshager Awoke Dagnew; Gassman Philip W.; Secchi Silvia; Schoof Justin T.,Graham Sustainability Institute\University of Michigan\United States; Iowa State University\Center for Agricultural and Rural Development\United States; Southern Illinois University Carbondale\Geography and Environmental Resources\United States,-,Agricultural watershed; BMP; SWAT; Targeted approach; Water quality
408.html,Degradation kinetics and mechanism of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole in an agricultural soil system with manure application,"Recently, under the application of waste-water, manure and biosolids, antibiotics have been used massively in agriculture resulted in antibiotic resistance and potential environmental risks. In the present study, the removal of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in an agricultural soil system was explored. All the experiments were conducted under different incubation conditions for 49 days. The experimental results indicated that all the degradation processes could effectively follow a first-order kinetic model. Based on the analyses of these two antibiotics, SDZ had a higher reaction rate and a shorter DT50 value. Additionally, there were no marked differences in DT50 values at varying initial concentrations under the same conditions (p > 0.05). Compared with the non-sterile soil, the degradation rates of SMX and SDZ were slower (< 70%), and the associated DT50 values (> 21 days) were higher in the sterile soil. Because the biodegradation played a major role, it may be effective for the removal of these contaminants from the soils. The processes of SDZ and SMX degradations were slightly accelerated by applying manure (< 20%). There were different accelerating effects on the removal of SDZ and SMX in soils by manure Single- and Repeated-application, which may be related to the amount of manure during the degradation processes, and different methods of adding manure could only affect the degradation rate. The major intermediate products were derived from the hydroxylation, sulfonamide S[sbnd]N bond cleavage and aniline moiety oxidation. Therefore, the present study inferred that possible degradation pathways of SDZ and SMX were hydroxylation of the benzene ring, oxidation of the amine group at the benzene ring, ring open and S[sbnd]N bond cleavage. Results revealed that more attention should be paid to the transformation products because they could be more toxic than the parent compounds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Yu; Hu Shuangqing; Zhang Hongchang; Shen Genxiang; Yuan Zhejun; Zhang Wei,State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Environmental Risk Assessment and Control on Chemical Process\School of Resource and Environmental Engineering\China; Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences\Shanghai\China; College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Donghua University\China,-,Degradation pathways; Manure; Soil; Sulfadiazine; Sulfamethoxazole
409.html,"Ambient sediment quality conditions in Minnesota lakes, USA: Effects of watershed parameters and aquatic health implications","Surficial sediments were collected from 50 randomly selected Minnesota lakes, plus four a priori reference lakes, in 2007. The lakes encompassed broad geographic coverage of the state and included a variety of major land uses in the surrounding watersheds. Sediment samples were analyzed for a suite of metals, metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, total organic carbon, and particle size fractions. In addition, a small fish survey was conducted to assess PBDEs in both whole fish and fish tissues. Sediment quality in this set of lakes ranged from good (43%) to moderate (57%) based on an integrative measure of multiple contaminants. On an individual basis, some contaminants (e.g., arsenic, lead, DDD, and DDE) exceeded benchmark values in a small number of lakes that would be detrimental to benthic invertebrates. The sediments in two developed lakes tended to be more contaminated than sediments in lakes from other major watershed land uses. These differences were often statistically significant (p < 0.05), particularly for lakes with developed versus cultivated land uses for arsenic, lead, zinc, and numerous PAH compounds. Multivariate statistical approaches were used on a subgroup of contaminants to show the two urban lakes, as well as a few northeastern Minnesota lakes, differed from the rest of the data set. Background threshold values were calculated for data with < 80% nondetects. Source apportionment modeling of PAHs revealed that vehicle emissions and coal-related combustion were the most common sources. A general environmental forensic analysis of the PCDD/F data showed that ubiquitous combustion sources appeared to be important. BDE-209, a decaBDE, was detected in 84% of lake sediment samples, whereas fish at the top of the food chain (i.e., predator trophic group) had significantly higher (p < 0.05) mean lipid-normalized concentrations of BDEs-47, 100, and 153 than lower trophic fish.

This study documents black carbon deposition in snow from a benchmark glacier on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Significant seasonality of BC concentrations indicates different input or post-depositional processes. BC particles deposited in snow had a mass volume median diameter slightly larger than that of black carbon particles typically found in the atmosphere. Also, unlike black carbon particles in the atmosphere, the particles deposited in snow did not exhibit highly fractal morphology by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. Footprint analysis indicated BC deposited on the glacier in summer originated mainly from Central Asia; in winter, the depositing air masses generally originated from Central Asia and Pakistan. Anthropogenic emissions play an important role on black carbon deposition in glacial snow, especially in winter. The mass absorption efficiency of BC in snow at 632 nm exhibited significantly seasonality, with higher values in summer and lower values in winter. The information on black carbon deposition in glacial snow provided in this study could be used to help mitigate the impacts of BC on glacier melting on the northern Tibetan Plateau. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Yulan; Kang Shichang; Li Chaoliu; Gao Tanguang; Cong Zhiyuan; Sprenger Michael; Liu Yajun; Li Xiaofei; Guo Junming; Sillanpää Mika; Wang Kun; Chen Jizu,State Key Laboratory of Cryosphere Sciences\Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources\China; CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences\Beijing\China; Key laboratory of Western China's Environmental System (Ministry of Education)\College of Earth and Environmental Sciences\China; Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science\ETH Zurich\Switzerland,-,BC morphology; BC size; Black carbon; Glacier; Tibetan Plateau

We used a mercury sphygmomanometer to measure BP. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic BP (SBP) of at least 140 mm Hg, and/or diastolic BP (DBP) of at least 90 mm Hg, and/or use of antihypertensive medications. The results showed that increased serum concentrations of all (both branched and linear) isomers of PFASs were associated with higher prevalence of hypertension. Adjusted odds ratios for hypertension per ln-unit (ng/mL) increase in PFASs ranged from 1.10 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.17) for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) to 1.26 (95%CI: 1.12, 1.42) for 3 + 4 + 5m PFOS, and the estimated increases in mean SBP and DBP ranged from 0.80 mm Hg (95%CI: 0.25, 1.34) for PFBA to 4.51 mm Hg (95%CI: 3.52, 5.51) for 3 + 4 + 5m PFOS, and from 0.51 mm Hg (95%CI: 0.01, 1.01) for perfluorodecanesulfonate (PFDS) to 2.48 (1.80, 3.16) for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), respectively. Compared with linear PFASs isomers, we identified more and stronger associations among branched PFASs isomers and blood pressure. Furthermore, females exhibited consistently stronger effects than males. In conclusion, this study is the first of its kind to show that not only PFASs positively associated with elevated blood pressure, but also that branched PFAS isomers are more frequently associated with blood pressure than linear PFAS isomers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bao Wen-Wen; Qian Zhengmin(Min); Geiger Sarah Dee; Liu Echu; Liu Yimin; Wang Si-Quan; Lawrence Wayne R.; Yang Bo-Yi; Hu Li-Wen; Zeng Xiao-Wen; Dong Guang-Hui,Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health Risk Assessment\Department of Preventive Medicine\China; Department of Epidemiology\College for Public Health and Social Justice\United States; School of Health Studies\Northern Illinois University\United States; Department of Health Management & Policy\College for Public Health and Social Justice\United States,-,Blood pressure; Hypertension; Isomers of C8 health project; Perfluroroalkyl substances (PFASs); PFASs isomers

413.html,Investigation of the wash-off process using an innovative portable rainfall simulator allowing continuous monitoring of flow and turbidity at the urban surface outlet,"Development of appropriate models, based on an in-depth understanding of the wash-off process, is essential to accurately estimating pollutant loads transported by stormwater, thereby minimizing environmental contamination. To this end, we developed an innovative rainfall simulator, which simulated an intense rainfall (120 mm/h) and permitted the acquisition of runoff samples as well as the in situ monitoring of continuous flow and turbidity dynamics. Relationships between deposited sediments and total suspended solids in simulated runoff were thus investigated on two different types of surfaces within the Paris region in terms of loads and particle size distribution. Results demonstrate the occurrence of first flush phenomenon on the sidewalks even under constant flow. Results also show that the highest fraction conveyed by runoff consisted of fine (< 16 μm) and medium-sized (< 100 μm) particles, whose detachment was more favorable from smooth surfaces than from rougher ones. In terms of stormwater quality modelling, results suggest that the integration of a wash-off fraction based on both particle size and rainfall intensity could be an entrance for a better prediction of stormwater pollution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Al Ali Saja; Bonhomme Céline; Dubois Philippe; Chebbo Ghassan,LEESU\MA 102\France; Université Libanaise\Ecole Doctorale de Sciences et Technologies\Lebanon; Faculty of Engineering III\Lebanese University\Lebanon,-,Particle size distribution; Rainfall simulation; Sediments; Stormwater; Wash-off process
414.html,Mitigation of nonpoint source pollution in rural areas: From control to synergies of multi ecosystem services,"Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution produced by human activities in rural areas has induced excessive nutrient input into surface waters and the decline of water quality. The essence of NPS pollution is the transport of nutrients between soil and water. Traditional NPS pollution control strategies, however, are mainly based on the solid and liquid phases, with little focus on the bio-phase between water and soil. The pollutants produced from NPS can be regarded as a resource if recycled or reused in an appropriate way in the agricultural ecosystem. This mini review proposes novel strategies for NPS pollution control based on three phases (liquid, solid and bio-phase) and highlights the regulating services of an agricultural ecosystem by optimizing land use/cover types. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wu Yonghong; Liu Junzhuo; Shen Renfang; Fu Bojie,State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture\Institute of Soil Science\China; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China,-,Ecosystem service; Formation; Nonpoint source pollution; Three phases
415.html,Influence of the stabilizers on the toxicity of metallic nanomaterials in aquatic organisms and human cell lines,"In this study, following a systematic approach, we used aquatic species (bacteria Vibrio fischeri and microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata) and different human cell lines (Caco-2, HepG2, SV-80 and HaCaT) representing different tissues and exposure pathways, to investigate how two organic stabilizers (PVA and DMSO) used for NMs dispersion influence their physicochemical properties, the persistence of metals in suspension and the toxicity/ecotoxicity of two metallic NMs (nano-Ag and nano-Cu). Although the stabilizers are expected to contribute to improve the dispersion and stability of NMs, the results obtained clearly showed that no similar changes in toxicity and morphological properties of the nano-Ag can be expected after its stabilization with PVA. Thus, regarding human cell lines, the reduction in the average size of the PVA-nano-Ag was followed by a reduction or maintenance of its toxicity, but the opposite was observed for the aquatic species tested since an increase in the average size enhanced its toxicity. As far as nano-Cu is considered DMSO contributed for a better dispersion of this nanomaterial, however this was not translated in a similar toxicity/ecotoxicity modification. In summary, even for nano-Cu, for which few or no data exists regarding its toxicity after stabilization with organic compounds, it was confirmed with consistent data, that the toxicity of metallic NMs is a complex combination of average size, chemical composition, solubilization or persistence in suspension of the metallic forms, interaction with test medium components and sensitivity of test species and cell lines. The combination of all of these factors makes the toxicity of metallic NMs unpredictable and points for the need of an extensive evaluation of each new formulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Andreani Tatiana; Nogueira Verónica; Pinto Vera V.; Ferreira Maria José; Rasteiro Maria Graça; Silva Amélia M.; Pereira Ruth; Pereira Carlos M.,Centro de Investigação em Química da Universidade do Porto\Departamento de Química e Bioquímica\Portugal; CITAB - Centre for Research and Technology of Agro-Environmental and Biological Sciences\University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro\Portugal; Department of Biology\Faculty of Sciences\Portugal; CIMAR - Interdisciplinary Center of Marine and Environmental Research\Rua dos Bragas\Portugal,-,Dispersion medium; Human cell lines; Metallic nanomaterials; Raphidocelis subcapitata; Toxicity; Vibrio fischeri
416.html,Combined sewer overflow events and childhood emergency department visits: A case-crossover study,"In localities with combined sewer systems, combined sewer overflow (CSO) events frequently occur following high precipitation and can result in the release of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater into surface waters. We hypothesized that either direct contact with or proximity to aerosolized CSO effluent would increase the risk for childhood emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses, and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in Cincinnati, OH, USA. ED visits for 2010–2014 due to GI diseases, asthma, and SSTIs were extracted from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center electronic health records. The location and timing of CSO events were obtained from the Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) of Greater Cincinnati. ED visits with a residential address within 500 m of a CSO site were used in a case-control crossover study with two bi-directional control periods. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of an ED visit associated with a CSO event at lag periods of 0 to 7 days. Statistically significant elevated risks for GI-related ED visits was observed two (OR: 1.16 [95% CI 1.04,1.30]) days after CSO events. CSO events were not significantly associated with asthma- or SSTI-related ED visits, but show similar trends. Our findings suggest an increased risk for GI-related ED visits following CSO events among children who reside near CSO sites. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brokamp Cole; Beck Andrew F.; Muglia Louis; Ryan Patrick,Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology\Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\United States; Divisions of General and Community Pediatrics and Hospital Medicine\Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\United States; Division of Human Genetics and Perinatal Institute\Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\United States,-,-
417.html,Methane uptake in global forest and grassland soils from 1981 to 2010,"Methane (CH4) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Although forest and grassland soils generally consume atmospheric CH4, the quantities and spatiotemporal changes in CH4uptake remain largely uncertain for these ecosystems at the global scale. In this study, we developed an empirical model to estimate the CH4uptake in global forest and grassland soils during the period 1981–2010. We estimated that the mean values of CH4uptake were 9.16 (± 3.84) Tg yr− 1in forest soils and 3.73 (± 1.41) Tg yr− 1in grassland soils during the study period. Tropical forest and grassland soils were determined to be the largest CH4sink, contributing 58% to the global total. During the 30-year period, the CH4uptake in cool temperate dry and warm temperate dry soils and in polar/boreal grassland soils increased significantly (P < 0.05) at rates of 0.30–2.95 Gg yr− 1owing mainly to increases in mean temperatures. However, the uptake decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in tropical dry grassland soils, at 1.22 Gg yr− 1, owing mainly to increases in precipitation. Ultimately, our simulation indicated that the global CH4uptake by forest and grassland soils increased significantly (P < 0.05) at rates of 4.67 Gg yr− 1and 2.98 Gg yr− 1, respectively, during the period 1981–2010. The trend of increasing sinks from forest and grassland and its relationship with temperature and precipitation variability imply that forest and grassland CH4sinks will play a positive role in climate change mitigation in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yu Lijun; Huang Yao; Zhang Wen; Li Tingting; Sun Wenjuan,LAPC\Institute of Atmospheric Physics\China; State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change\Institute of Botany\China,-,CH4uptake; Climate zone; Forest soils; Global; Grassland soils
418.html,"Reuse water: Exposure duration, seasonality and treatment affect tissue responses in a model fish","Partially remediated gray (reuse) water will likely find increasing use in a variety of applications owing to the increasing scarcity of freshwater. We aimed to determine if a model fish, the goldfish, could sense reuse water using olfaction (smell), and if 30 min or 7 d (acute) and 60 d (sub-chronic) exposures would affect their olfactory responses to natural odorants. We examined olfaction as previous studies have found that numerous chemicals can impair the olfactory sense, which is critical to carrying out numerous life-sustaining behaviors from feeding to mating. We also examined if fish olfactory and liver tissues would mount a response in terms of biotransformation enzyme gene expression, and whether treatment of reuse water with UV/H2O2ameliorated adverse effects following reuse water exposure. We found that fish olfactory tissue responded to reuse water as it would to a natural odorant and that UV/H2O2treatment had no influence on this. With acute exposures, olfactory impairment was apparent regardless of water type (e.g. responses of 23–55% of control), but in sub-chronic exposures, only the untreated reuse water caused olfactory impairment. The exposure of fish to reuse water increased the expression of one enzyme (CYP1A; > 2.5–6.5 fold change) and reuse water treatment with UV/H2O2reversed the effect. There was a seasonal effect that was likely due to changes in water quality (60 d summer exposure impaired olfaction whereas spring and fall exposures did not). Overall, the data suggest that reuse water may be detected by olfaction, impair olfactory responses in fish receiving unavoidable exposures, and that exposure duration and season are important factors to consider regarding adverse effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Biological Sciences\University of Alberta\Canada; Civil and Environmental Engineering\University of Alberta\Canada; School of Public Health\University of Alberta\Canada,-,CYP1A; CYP3A; Fish; Municipal reuse water; PPCP; UV/H2O2

Samples were collected and analyzed over a five-year period, from 2011 to 2016. Detectable levels of134Cs and137Cs were found in 142 of 180 (80%) Japanese particulate matter samples. The median radio-cesium specific activity of Japanese particulate samples was 3.2 kBq kg− 1± 1.8 kBq kg− 1, and the mean was 25.7 kBq kg− 1(σ = 72 kBq kg− 1). The U.S. and Canadian mean and median radio‑cesium activity levels were < 0.03 kBq kg− 1. U.S. and Canadian samples had detectable134Cs and137Cs in one dust sample out of 32 collected, and four soils out of 74. The maximum US/Canada radio-cesium particulate matter activity was 0.30 ± 0.10 kBq kg− 1. The mean in Japan was skewed upward due to nine of the 180 (5%) samples with activities > 250 kBq kg− 1. This skewness was present in both the 2011 and 2016 sample sets. > 300 individual radioactively-hot particles were identified in samples from Japan; composed of 1% or more of the elements cesium, americium, radium, polonium, thorium, tellurium, or strontium. Some particles reached specific activities in the MBq μg− 1level and higher. No cesium-containing hot particles were found in the U.S. sample set. Only naturally-occurring radionuclides were found in particles from the U.S. background samples. Some of the hot particles detected in this study could cause significant radiation exposures to individuals if inhaled. Exposure models ignoring these isolated hot particles would potentially understate human radiation dose. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kaltofen Marco; Gundersen Arnie,Nuclear Science and Engineering Program\Department of Physics\United States; Fairewinds Energy Education Corp\70 South Winooski Ave. #289\United States,-,Autoradiography; Gamma spectrometry; Radioactively-hot particles; SEM/EDS

420.html,"Health consequences of electric lighting practices in the modern world: A report on the National Toxicology Program's workshop on shift work at night, artificial light at night, and circadian disruption","The invention of electric light has facilitated a society in which people work, sleep, eat, and play at all hours of the 24-hour day. Although electric light clearly has benefited humankind, exposures to electric light, especially light at night (LAN), may disrupt sleep and biological processes controlled by endogenous circadian clocks, potentially resulting in adverse health outcomes. Many of the studies evaluating adverse health effects have been conducted among night- and rotating-shift workers, because this scenario gives rise to significant exposure to LAN. Because of the complexity of this topic, the National Toxicology Program convened an expert panel at a public workshop entitled “Shift Work at Night, Artificial Light at Night, and Circadian Disruption” to obtain input on conducting literature-based health hazard assessments and to identify data gaps and research needs. The Panel suggested describing light both as a direct effector of endogenous circadian clocks and rhythms and as an enabler of additional activities or behaviors that may lead to circadian disruption, such as night-shift work and atypical and inconsistent sleep-wake patterns that can lead to social jet lag. Future studies should more comprehensively characterize and measure the relevant light-related exposures and link these exposures to both time-independent biomarkers of circadian disruption and biomarkers of adverse health outcomes. This information should lead to improvements in human epidemiological and animal or in vitro models, more rigorous health hazard assessments, and intervention strategies to minimize the occurrence of adverse health outcomes due to these exposures. © 2017",Lunn Ruth M.; Blask David E.; Coogan Andrew N.; Figueiro Mariana G.; Gorman Michael R.; Hall Janet E.; Hansen Johnni; Nelson Randy J.; Panda Satchidananda; Smolensky Michael H.; Stevens Richard G.; Turek Fred W.,Office of the Report on Carcinogens\Division of the National Toxicology Program\United States; Department of Structural and Cellular Biology\Laboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology\United States; Maynooth University Department of Psychology\National University of Ireland\Ireland; Light and Health Program\Lighting Research Center\United States,-,Artificial light at night (ALAN); Circadian disruption; Light at night (LAN); Shift work
421.html,"Evaluating mercury concentrations and body condition in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR), Florida","Concentrations of mercury (Hg) are not well studied in free-ranging wildlife. Atmospheric deposition patterns of Hg have been studied in detail and have been modeled for both global and specific locations and often correlate to environmental impact. However, monitoring the impact of Hg deposition in wildlife is complicated due to local environmental conditions that can affect the transformation of atmospheric Hg to the biologically available forms (e.g., rainfall, humidity, pH, the ability of the environment to methylate Hg), as well as affect the accessibility to organisms for sampling. In this study, Hg concentrations in blood samples from a population of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR), FL, USA, over a seven-year period (2007 to 2014; n = 174 individuals) were examined to assess Hg variation in the population, as well as the difference in Hg concentration as a function of health status. While most of this population is healthy, 18 individuals with low body mass indices (BMI, defined in this study) were captured throughout the sampling period. These alligators exhibited significantly elevated Hg concentrations compared to their age/sex/season matched counterparts with normal BMI, suggesting that health status should be taken into account when examining Hg concentrations and effects. Alligator blood Hg concentrations were related to the interaction of age/size, sex, and season. This study illustrates the value of a routinely monitored population of large predators in a unique coastal wetland ecosystem, and illuminates the value of long-term environmental exposure assessment. © 2017",Nilsen Frances M.; Dorsey Jonathan E.; Lowers Russell H.; Guillette Louis J.; Long Stephen E.; Bowden John A.; Schock Tracey B.,Medical University of South Carolina\Charleston\United States; National Institute of Standards and Technology\Hollings Marine Lab\United States; Integrated Mission Support Service (IMSS)\Titusville\United States,-,Alligator; Behavior; Florida; Health; Mercury; Seasonal
422.html,"Concurrent exposures to nonylphenol, bisphenol A, phthalates, and organophosphate pesticides on birth outcomes: A cohort study in Taipei, Taiwan","Prenatal exposure to phenols, phthalates (PAEs), and organophosphate (OP) pesticides may increase the risk of abnormal birth outcomes. However, many previous studies have examined exposure to a limited number of chemical classes or exposure profiles limited to a specific stage of pregnancy. This study aims to characterize the concurrent exposure scenario throughout pregnancy by simultaneously monitoring internal doses of several endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), including 2 phenols (nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA)), 9 PAEs, and 6 OP pesticide metabolites and to assess the relationships between concurrent exposure to EDCs and infant birth weight, length, and head and chest circumference. One hundred and sixty two women provided three spot urine samples at approximately 11 and 26 weeks gestation and at delivery. We applied multivariable linear regression and ridge regression models to estimate the effects of separate and correlated exposures. Multivariable linear regression models revealed that women with short birth-length infants had significantly higher urinary second-trimester NP levels (50th percentile, 5.03 μg/g creatinine) (β = − 0.47 cm; 95% CI = − 0.93 to − 0.01). Similarly significant relationships were observed between second-trimester mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) exposure and short birth length, second-trimester ΣPAEs and short birth length, second-trimester ΣPAEs exposure and reduced head and chest circumference, second-trimester diethylphosphate (DEP) exposure and reduced birth weight and length, and second-trimester ΣDEPs exposure and short birth length. Women with urinary BPA above the 75th percentile or ΣPAEs levels above the 50th percentile in the third trimester had infants with significantly reduced head circumference. These observations suggest that the second trimester may be the critical stage of susceptibility for fetal development. In ridge regression models, for which women with fewer measures for exposure to NP, BPA, MMP, ΣPAEs, DEP and ΣDEPs simultaneously were available, no relationships were found with infant size at birth. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are warranted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Huang Yu-Fang; Pan Wen-Chi; Tsai Yen-An; Chang Chia-Huang; Chen Pei-Jung; Shao Yi-shuan; Tsai Ming-Song; Hou Jia-Woei; Lu Chensheng (Alex); Chen Mei-Lien,Institute of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences\School of Medicine\Taiwan; Department of Environmental Health\Harvard T.H.

423.html,Role of dams in the phase transfer of antibiotics in an urban river receiving wastewater treatment plant effluent,"Dams are universally constructed to change hydrodynamic forces and impound water in urban rivers, but few efforts have been made to expound the impact of dams on the transport of antibiotics in rivers. In this study, the main object and focus was to elucidate the intercept effect of rubber dam and the gate dam on the sediment-water phase redistribution of eight typical antibiotics along an urban river with the water replenished from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results show that the eight antibiotics were widely detected in the whole river segment, and the WWTPs were found to be the main sources. Among the eight antibiotics, fluoroquinolones had the highest concentrations in the surface water, while tetracyclines constituted the dominant composition in the sediments. Due to the retention effect, the rubber dam encouraged the enrichment and degradation of the antibiotics in the river. However, the role of gate dams depended mainly on the opening and closing of the sluice gate. For all eight antibiotics, each dam or WWTP exhibited a generally consistent impact on the changes (e.g., an increase or decrease) of the sediment-water partitioning coefficients, although obvious differences existed between effect degree. Moreover, the changes in the coefficients caused by the rubber dam were completely opposite to those affected by gate dams. Contrary to the other six antibiotics, the two sulfonamides showed significant relationships with the dissolved organic matter in the surface water but had no significant relationships with the organic matter in the sediments. © 2017",Guo Xiaoyu; Feng Chenghong; Zhang Jianhong; Tian Chenhao; Liu Jingling,State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation\School of Environment\China; Key Laboratory for Water and Sediment Science of Ministry of Education\School of Environment\China; Resources & Environment Business Dept.\China International Engineering Consulting Corporation\China,-,Antibiotics; Dam; Organic matter; Urban river; Wastewater treatment plant
424.html,Microalgae-bacteria models evolution: From microalgae steady-state to integrated microalgae-bacteria wastewater treatment models – A comparative review,"The search for environmentally neutral alternative fuels had revived the interest for microalgae-bacteria wastewater treatment systems. The potential achieving of bioproducts from microalgae biomass has also greatly contributed. The reactions that occur in these systems are complex, and the degree of scientific knowledge is still scarce compared to that of conventional bacteria wastewater treatments. Mathematical models offer a great opportunity to study the simultaneous effect of the multiple factors affecting microalgae and bacteria, thus allowing for the prediction of final biomass production, and contributing to the system design optimization in terms of operation and control. During the last decades, numerous models describing microalgae growth have been proposed. However, a lower number of integral models considering microalgae as well as bacteria is available. In this paper, the evolution of microalgae models from simple steady-state models (usually dependent on one factor) to more complex dynamic models (with two or more factors) has been revised. A summary of integrated microalgae-bacteria models has been reviewed, outlining their main features and presenting their processes and value parameters. Eventually, a critical discussion on integrated models has been put forward. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Solimeno Alessandro; García Joan,GEMMA – Group of Environmental Engineering and Microbiology\Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\Spain,-,Algae-bacteria; High rate algal ponds; Photobioreactors; Simulation; Waste stabilization ponds
425.html,"Changes in reference evapotranspiration and its driving factors in the middle reaches of Yellow River Basin, China","Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is important for agricultural, environmental and other studies, and understanding the attribution of its change is helpful to provide information for irrigation scheduling and water resources management. The present study investigates the attribution of the change of ET0at 49 meteorological stations in the middle reaches of Yellow River basin (MRYRB) of China from 1960 to 2012. Results show that annual ET0increases from the northwest to the southeast of MRYRB in space. We find that annual ET0clearly presents a zigzag change pattern rather than a monotonically change during the whole period. The detected three breakpoints at 1972, 1988 and 1997 divide the whole period into four subperiods. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ET0is the most sensitive to surface solar radiation (Rs), followed by relative humidity (RH) and mean air temperature (T), and the least sensitive to wind speed (u) in our study area. Furthermore, we find that ET0is becoming less sensitive to RH and more sensitive to T during 1960–2012. The attributions of the change in ET0vary largely at different regions and subperiods. The declined wind speed is the dominant factor, followed by Rs to the ET0reduction during 1960–2012. Further analysis shows that Rs and u are the two major contributing factors that control the change of ET0at most stations and during most subperiods. Our study confirms that the change of ET0is influenced by the complex interactions of climatic factors, and the dominant factor to the change of ET0is different in various regions and time periods. The results presented here can provide a reference for agricultural production and water resources management in MRYRB as well as other semi-arid and semi-humid regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",She Dunxian; Xia Jun; Zhang Yongyong,State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science\Wuhan University\China; Hubei Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Water Resources Security\Wuhan\China; Key Laboratory of Water Cycle and Related Land Surface Processes\Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research\China,-,Changing trends; Differential equation method; Middle reach of Yellow River Basin; Sensitivity analysis

The surface part of a technosol at the edge of dump was analysed mineralogically, geochemically and bacteriologically. From the technosol rich in petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals three isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were recovered. Isolates from technosol shared many features that are previously described for clinically isolates: the affiliation to IC1 and 2, multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) antibiotic resistance profile, carbapenem resistance mediated by blaOXA72and blaOXA23genes, and the expression of virulence factors. In in vitro conditions, isolates were able to survive in contact with technosol during 58 days of monitoring. The most probable source of A. baumannii in technosol was the illegally disposed hospital waste.

The median concentrations of PBDEs, NBFRs and DPs were 40, 23 and 0.21 pg/m3, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated the common source and/or similar environmental behavior for several HFRs. The Clausius–Clapeyron equation was applied to diagnose the sources of lower molecular weight HFRs (LMW-HFRs), which suggested that the gaseous LMW-HFRs at Lhasa were more controlled by regional or long-range atmospheric transport rather than the temperature-driven evaporation from local contaminated surfaces. Finally, the potential source contribution function model was applied to assess the influences of air parcels on the atmospheric concentrations of HFRs in Lhasa, which suggested that the sources of higher molecular weight HFRs (HMW-HFRs) were mostly originated from local emissions, while the others were originated from long-range atmospheric transport. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ma Wan-Li; Li Wen-Long; Zhang Zi-Feng; Liu Li-Yan; Song Wei-Wei; Huo Chun-Yan; Yuan Yi-Xing; Li Yi-Fan,International Joint Research Center for Persistent Toxic Substances (IJRC-PTS)\State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment\China; IJRC-PTS-NA\Toronto\Canada,-,Atmosphere; Halogenated flame retardants; Source apportionment; Tibetan Plateau

We performed a cross-sectional study in a representative sample from this archipelago to evaluate whether serum levels of selected POPs could be considered as risk factors for diabetes in this population. Serum levels of 30 POPs were determined in 429 adults (9.3% with T2D). We found that serum levels of p,p′-DDE (DDE), PCB-153 and PCB-118 were significantly higher among subjects having diabetes than in non-diabetic subjects (p = 0.001, p = 0.046, and p < 0.0001, respectively). We observed a positive correlation between serum p,p′-DDE and glucose levels. Serum p,p′-DDE was identified as a risk factor for diabetes in univariate analysis in the whole series, and it remained as an independent risk factor for diabetes in subjects with serum glucose < 126 mg/dL (multivariate analysis, Exp(B) = 1.283, CI 95% (1.023–1.611), p = 0.031). Those normoglycemic subjects that are most exposed to p,p′-DDE (95th percentile: serum p,p′-DDE > 5 μg/L) seem to be those people at higher risk. Our results showed that p,p′-DDE levels were significantly higher among subjects having diabetes. These findings should be considered by public health Authorities to implement measures devoted to minimize human exposure to pollutants that could be harmful to the population. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Henríquez-Hernández Luis Alberto; Luzardo Octavio P.; Valerón Pilar F.; Zumbado Manuel; Serra-Majem Lluis; Camacho María; González-Antuña Ana; Boada Luis D.,Toxicology Unit\Research Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS)\Spain; Preventive Medicine Unit\Research Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS)\Spain,-,Canary Islands; Diabetes; Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethylene; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls
429.html,Exposure to particulate air pollution during early pregnancy is associated with placental DNA methylation,"Maternal exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm (PM10) during pregnancy results in adverse birth outcomes. Changes in placental DNA methylation might mediate those adverse effects. In this study, we examined the associations between prenatal PM10exposure and DNA methylation of LINE1, HSD11B2 and NR3C1 in human placenta. One hundred and eighty-one mother newborn pairs (80 fetal growth restriction newborns, 101 normal newborns) participated in this study. The average PM10exposure of each trimester and of the whole pregnancy was calculated using daily air pollution concentration data. Placental DNA methylation was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction-pyrosequencing. Placental LINE-1 DNA methylation was reversely associated with first trimester PM10exposure 1.78% (− β = 1.78, 95% CI: − 3.35, − 0.22%), while placental HSD11B2 DNA methylation was associated with both first and second trimester PM10exposure, and relatively increased by 1.03% (95% CI: 0.07, 1.98%) and 2.33% (95% CI: 0.69, 3.76%) for each 10 μg/m3increase in exposure to PM10. Those associations were much more evident in fetal growth restriction newborns than those in normal newborns. In summary, early pregnancy PM10exposure was associated with placental DNA methylation of LINE1 and HSD11B2, suggesting that such methylation alterations might mediate PM-induced reproductive and developmental toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cai Jing; Zhao Yan; Liu Pengcheng; Xia Bin; Zhu Qingyang; Wang Xiu; Song Qi; Kan Haidong; Zhang Yunhui,Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety\Ministry of Education\China; CITIC Medical & Health Group\Beijing\China,-,Birth outcome; DNA methylation; Particulate air pollution; Placenta

430.html,Vertical patterns and controls of soil nutrients in alpine grassland: Implications for nutrient uptake,"Vertical patterns and determinants of soil nutrients are critical to understand nutrient cycling in high-altitude ecosystems; however, they remain poorly understood in the alpine grassland due to lack of systematic field observations. In this study, we examined vertical distributions of soil nutrients and their influencing factors within the upper 1 m of soil, using data of 68 soil profiles surveyed in the alpine grassland of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks decreased with depth in both alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS), but remain constant along the soil profile in alpine swamp meadow (ASM). Total phosphorus, Ca2 +, and Mg2 +stocks slightly increased with depth in ASM. K+stock decreased with depth, while Na+stock increased slightly with depth among different vegetation types; however, SO42 −and Cl−stocks remained relatively uniform throughout different depth intervals in the alpine grassland. Except for SOC and TN, soil nutrient stocks in the top 20 cm soils were significantly lower in ASM compared to those in AM and AS. Correlation analyses showed that SOC and TN stocks in the alpine grassland positively correlated with vegetation coverage, soil moisture, clay content, and silt content, while they negatively related to sand content and soil pH. However, base cation stocks revealed contrary relationships with those environmental variables compared to SOC and TN stocks. These correlations varied between vegetation types. In addition, no significant relationship was detected between topographic factors and soil nutrients. Our findings suggest that plant cycling and soil moisture primarily control vertical distributions of soil nutrients (e.g. K) in the alpine grassland and highlight that vegetation types in high-altitude permafrost regions significantly affect soil nutrients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tian Liming; Zhao Lin; Wu Xiaodong; Fang Hongbing; Zhao Yonghua; Yue Guangyang; Liu Guimin; Chen Hao,Cryosphere Research Station on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; College of Earth Environmental Sciences\Lanzhou University\China; School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering\Lanzhou Jiaotong University\China,-,Alpine grassland; Nutrient cycling; Permafrost; Qinghai-Tibet plateau; Soil nutrient
431.html,"Impact of the NSAID diclofenac on survival, development, behaviour and health of embryonic and juvenile stages of brown trout, Salmo trutta f. fario","The NSAID diclofenac is controversially discussed with respect to its environmental relevance. Since further information is need to assess whether diclofenac should be included as substance of priority in the EU water framework directive, we investigated the impact of this analgesic on the embryonic development of brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) from fertilized egg until the end of sac-fry stage and studied effects in juvenile fish six months post hatch. Embryos were exposed to five test concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 100 μg/L) over 127 days at 7 °C. None of the treatments affected mortality, hatching, development or heart rate. Six months old juveniles exposed to five concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100, 200 μg/L) over 25 days at 7 °C, however, showed increased mortality, reaching significance at 100 μg/L. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of juvenile animals bore injuries at concentrations higher 10 μg/L. Neither the levels of the stress protein Hsp70, nor the amount of lipid peroxides was affected by any of the treatments. Histological analyses of gill, liver and kidney revealed visible tissue reactions in fish from all experimental groups. Histological responses in livers of diclofenac-exposed fish outstripped the status of laboratory control fish, particularly when exposed to the two highest concentrations. Chemical analyses of fish muscle tissue revealed concentration-dependent uptake of DCF into the animal, but no relevant bioconcentration. Our study supports earlier findings indicating a lower sensitivity of trout early life stages compared to older individuals, suggesting that studies for risk assessment of diclofenac should predominantly focus on later life stages. Furthermore, fish mortality was found to increase with rising diclofenac concentrations, and the lowest observed effect concentration of 10 μg/L on the organismic level emphasises the classification of diclofenac as a micropollutant that requires close attention. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Schwarz Simon; Schmieg Hannah; Scheurer Marco; Köhler Heinz-R.; Triebskorn Rita,Animal Physiological Ecology\University of Tübingen\Germany; TZW: DVGW-Technologiezentrum Wasser\Karlsruher Straße 84\Germany; Steinbeis Transfer Center for Ecotoxicology and Ecophysiology\Blumenstr. 13\Germany,-,Embryo test; Histology; Lipid peroxides; Mortality; Stress proteins
432.html,Gauging policy-driven large-scale vegetation restoration programmes under a changing environment: Their effectiveness and socio-economic relationships,"Large-scale ecological restoration has been widely accepted globally as an effective strategy for combating environmental crises and to facilitate sustainability. Assessing the effectiveness of ecological restoration is vital for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers. However, few practical tools are available to perform such tasks, particularly for large-scale restoration programmes in complex socio-ecological systems. By taking a “before and after” design, this paper formulates a composite index (Ej) based on comparing the trends of vegetation cover and vegetation productivity to assess ecological restoration effectiveness. The index reveals the dynamic and spatially heterogenic process of vegetation restoration across different time periods, which can be informative for ecological restoration management at regional scales. Effectiveness together with its relationship to socio-economic factors is explored via structural equation modeling for three time periods. The results indicate that the temporal scale is a crucial factor in representing restoration effectiveness, and that the effects of socio-economic factors can also vary with time providing insight for improving restoration effectiveness. A dual-track strategy, which promotes the development of tertiary industry in absorbing the rural labor force together with improvements in agricultural practices, is proposed as a promising strategy for enhancing restoration effectiveness. In this process, timely and long-term ecological restoration monitoring is advocated, so that the success and sustainability of such programmes is ensured, together with more informative decision making where socio-ecological interactions at differing temporal scales are key concerns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Ting; Lü Yihe; Fu Bojie; Comber Alexis J.; Harris Paul; Wu Lianhai,State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; Joint Center for Global Change Studies\Beijing\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA) and School of Geography\University of Leeds\United Kingdom,-,Ecological restoration; Effectiveness assessment; Rural economy; Socio-ecological system; Structural equation modeling; Temporal scale
433.html,"Application of a crustacean bioassay to evaluate a multi-contaminated (metal, PAH, PCB) harbor sediment before and after electrokinetic remediation using eco-friendly enhancing agents","Electrokinetic (EK) remediation can be a suitable technology for treating contaminated dredged harbor sediment, stored on terrestrial disposal sites. Citric acid (CA) and biosurfactants (rhamnolipids and saponin) were chosen as enhancing agents for simultaneous metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn) and PAH/PCB removal by EK because of their potential low toxicity with a view to site restoration. Three EK runs were performed using a periodic voltage (1 V cm− 1) and various concentrations of agents. The best combination of CA (0.2 mol L− 1) and saponin (0.85 g L− 1) did not remove high amounts of metals (4.4–15.8%) and provided only slightly better results for PAH and PCB removal (29.2% and 38.2%, respectively). The harbor sediment was highly resistant to metal and organics mobilization and transport because of an aged contamination, a high buffering capacity, a very low hydraulic permeability and a high organic matter content. The efficiency of the EK process was also assessed by measuring the acute toxicity of the EK-treated sediment on E. affinis copepods exposed to sediment elutriates. Fortunately, the use of CA and biosurfactants did not significantly impact on sediment toxicity. Some treated sediment sections, particularly those near the anode compartment, were statistically more toxic than the raw sediment. More particularly, E. affinis copepods were significantly sensitive to low pH values and oxidative conditions, to Cu, and to a lesser extent to Pb amounts. The speciation of these metals probably changed in these pH and redox conditions so that they became more easily leachable and bioavailable. In contrast, toxicity was negatively correlated to PAH and PCB amounts after EK treatment, probably due to the production of oxidized metabolites of PAHs and PCBs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Normandie University\ULHN\France; Normandie University\URN\France; Normandie University\ULHN\France,-,Acute toxicity; Biosurfactants; Copepods; Electrokinetic remediation; Eurytemora affinis; Mixed contamination
434.html,Influence of temperature in pollution-induced community tolerance approaches used to assess effects of copper on freshwater phototrophic periphyton,"By measuring levels of tolerance to toxicants in microbial communities using functional toxicity tests under controlled conditions, pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approaches offer an effect-based tool to assess the ecological risk of chemicals in aquatic systems. However, induced tolerance of exposed microbial communities cannot always be attributed solely to the presence of toxicants as various environmental factors, such as temperature, can also be involved. Several PICT studies have been conducted to assess the effects of copper (Cu) on phototrophic periphyton, but little is known about the influence of temperature on the response of these microbial communities to acute and chronic exposure to Cu. Here, we report on a microcosm approach to assess the effects of two contrasting temperatures (18 °C and 28 °C) on (i) the baseline level of Cu tolerance in non-Cu-exposed phototrophic periphyton (i.e. effect of temperature on tolerance baseline), (ii) Cu tolerance acquisition by phototrophic periphyton in response to a 3-week chronic exposure to Cu at a nominal concentration of 60 μg L− 1(i.e. effect of temperature on PICT selection) and (iii) tolerance measured during short-term toxicity tests (i.e. effect of temperature on PICT detection). The aim was to evaluate how temperature conditions during the different phases of the PICT approaches may modify the causal relationship between chronic Cu exposure and measured Cu tolerance levels. Our results evidence the influence of temperature both on the basal capacity of phototrophic periphyton to tolerate subsequent exposure to Cu (i.e. influence on tolerance baseline) and on its capacity to acquire tolerance following chronic exposure to Cu (i.e. influence on PICT selection). Hence temperature must be considered when using PICT to establish causal links between chronic Cu exposure and effects on phototrophic periphyton. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lambert Anne Sophie; Dabrin Aymeric; Foulquier Arnaud; Morin Soizic; Rosy Christophe; Coquery Marina; Pesce Stéphane,Irstea\UR MALY\France; Laboratoire d'Écologie Alpine - UMR CNRS 5553\Université Grenoble Alpes\France; Irstea\UR EABX\France,-,Biofilm; Combined stress; Metal; Microbial ecotoxicology; PICT; Short-term toxicity tests
435.html,Effects of nitrogen deposition on soil microbial communities in temperate and subtropical forests in China,"Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition has aroused large concerns because of its potential negative effects on forest ecosystems. Although microorganisms play a vital role in ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, the effect of N deposition on soil microbiota still remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the responses of microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and microbial community composition to 4–5 years of experimentally simulated N deposition in temperate needle-leaf forests and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in eastern China, using chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methods. We found idiosyncratic effects of N addition on microbial biomass in these two types of forest ecosystems. In the subtropical forests, N addition showed a significant negative effect on microbial biomass and community composition, while the effect of N addition was not significant in the temperate forests. The N addition decreased MBC, MBN, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the F/B ratio (ratio of fungi to bacteria biomass) in the subtropical forests, likely due to a decreased soil pH and changes in the plant community composition. These results showed that microbial biomass and community composition in subtropical forests, compared with the temperate forests, were sensitive to N deposition. Our findings suggest that N deposition may have negative influence on soil microorganisms and potentially alter carbon and nutrient cycling in subtropical forests, rather than in temperate forests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tian Di; Jiang Lai; Ma Suhui; Fang Wenjing; Schmid Bernhard; Xu Longchao; Zhu Jianxiao; Li Peng; Losapio Gianalberto; Jing Xin; Zheng Chengyang; Shen Haihua,Department of Ecology\College of Urban and Environmental Sciences\China; Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies\University of Zurich\Switzerland; State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change\Institute of Botany\China; Department of Forestry\Anhui Agricultural University\China,-,Forest ecosystem; Microbial biomass; Microbial community; N deposition; PLFA
436.html,The use of gamma-survey measurements to better understand radon potential in urban areas,"Accounting for as much as 14% of all lung cancers worldwide, cumulative radon progeny exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer among never-smokers both internationally and in the United States. To understand the risk of radon progeny exposure, studies have mapped radon potential using aircraft-based measurements of gamma emissions. However, these efforts are hampered in urban areas where the built environment obstructs aerial data collection. To address part of this limitation, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using in situ gamma readings (taken with a scintillation probe attached to a ratemeter) to assess radon potential in an urban environment: DeKalb County, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, Georgia, USA. After taking gamma measurements at 402 survey sites, empirical Bayesian kriging was used to create a continuous surface of predicted gamma readings for the county. We paired these predicted gamma readings with indoor radon concentration data from 1351 residential locations. Statistical tests showed the interpolated gamma values were significantly but weakly positively related with indoor radon concentrations, though this relationship is decreasingly informative at finer geographic scales. Geology, gamma readings, and indoor radon were interrelated, with granitic gneiss generally having the highest gamma readings and highest radon concentrations and ultramafic rock having the lowest of each. Our findings indicate the highest geogenic radon potential may exists in the relatively undeveloped southeastern part of the county. It is possible that in situ gamma, in concert with other variables, could offer an alternative to aerial radioactivity measurements when determining radon potential, though future work will be needed to address this project's limitations. © 2017",Berens Andrew S.; Diem Jeremy; Stauber Christine; Dai Dajun; Foster Stephanie; Rothenberg Richard,Department of Geosciences\Georgia State University\United States; Geospatial Research\Analysis\United States; School of Public Health\Georgia State University\United States,-,Gamma; Geology; Public health; Radiation; Radon
437.html,Vascular and cardiac autonomic function and PM2.5constituents among the elderly: A longitudinal study,"Background Although epidemiologic studies have shown an association between the total mass of particulate matter < 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and cardiovascular disease, few studies have examined PM2.5constituents associated with vascular and cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Methods In this longitudinal study, we investigated the relationship between PM2.5constituents and blood pressure (BP), and markers of the autonomic nervous system. In 466 elderly subjects residing in communities in Seoul, Korea, we examined 16 constituents, seven sources, and total mass concentrations of PM2.5. We measured the BP, heart rate (HR), and indices of heart rate variability (HRV), such as the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (rMSSD), and two frequency-domain variables (low frequency [LF] and high frequency [HF]). We used linear mixed effects models to assess the association of PM2.5constituents and sources with cardiovascular markers. Results BP, HR, and rMSSD were associated with concentration of total mass of PM2.5. For each increase of the interquartile range in PM2.5constituents, systolic and diastolic BP, and HR increased by 2.1–3.3 mm Hg, 1.2–2.3 mm Hg, and 1.2–1.9 bpm, respectively, while the rMSSD, LF, and HF decreased by 8.1–9.3%, 16.6%, and 20.4%, respectively. Particularly, elemental carbon, sulfate, ammonium, lead, and strontium in the PM2.5constituents and emissions from oil combustion and incineration were associated with increased BP, HR, and decreased HRV. Conclusions Our results suggest an association between specific PM2.5constituents and vascular and cardiac autonomic functions. These findings may provide supportive evidence for developing a pollution reduction plan to prevent cardiovascular diseases. © 2017",Lim Youn-Hee; Bae Hyun-Joo; Yi Seung-Muk; Park EunHa; Lee Bo-Eun; Hong Yun-Chul,Institute of Environmental Medicine\Seoul National University Medical Research Center\South Korea; Environmental Health Center\Seoul National University College of Medicine\South Korea; Korea Environment Institute\Sejong\South Korea; Department of Environmental Health\Graduate School of Public Health\South Korea,-,Air pollution; Autonomic nervous system; Blood pressure; Heart rate; Particulate matter
438.html,Long-term litter manipulation alters soil organic matter turnover in a temperate deciduous forest,"Understanding soil organic matter (OM) biogeochemistry at the molecular-level is essential for assessing potential impacts from management practices and climate change on shifts in soil carbon storage. Biomarker analyses and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used in an ongoing detrital input and removal treatment experiment in a temperate deciduous forest in Pennsylvania, USA, to examine how above- and below-ground plant inputs control soil OM quantity and quality at the molecular-level. From plant material to surface soils, the free acyclic lipids and cutin, suberin, and lignin biomarkers were preferentially retained over free sugars and free cyclic lipids. After 20 years of above-ground litter addition (Double Litter) or exclusion (No Litter) treatments, soil OM composition was relatively more degraded, as revealed by solid-state13C NMR spectroscopy. Under Doubled Litter inputs, soil carbon and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations were unchanged, suggesting that the current OM degradation status is a reflection of microbial-mediated degradation that occurred prior to the 20-year sampling campaign. Soil OM degradation was higher in the No Litter treatments, likely due to the decline in fresh, above-ground litter inputs over time. Furthermore, root and root and litter exclusion treatments (No Roots and No Inputs, respectively) both significantly reduced free sugars and PLFAs and increased preservation of suberin-derived compounds. PLFA stress ratios and the low N-acetyl resonances from diffusion edited1H NMR also indicate substrate limitations and reduced microbial biomass with these treatments. Overall, we highlight that storage of soil carbon and its biochemical composition do not linearly increase with plant inputs because the microbial processing of soil OM is also likely altered in the studied forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Jun-Jian; Pisani Oliva; Lin Lisa H.; Lun Olivia O.Y.; Bowden Richard D.; Lajtha Kate; Simpson André J.; Simpson Myrna J.,Environmental NMR Centre\Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences\Canada; Department of Environmental Science\Allegheny College\United States; Department of Crop and Soil Science\Oregon State University\United States,-,Carbohydrates; Cutin; Detrital input and removal treatment (DIRT); Lignin; Lipids; Suberin
439.html,Forecasting PM2.5induced male lung cancer morbidity in China using satellite retrieved PM2.5and spatial analysis,"The present study predicts a spatial distribution of lung cancer morbidity in Chinese males due to exposure to PM2.5concentration from 2010 to 2015. A spatial autocorrelation method was used to evaluate the spatial relationship between the lung cancer morbidities from 2006 to 2009 and satellite-derived PM2.5atmospheric levels. A comprehensive grey correlation degree analysis was carried out to assess the simultaneous and lag associations between the lung cancer morbidity and PM2.5concentration. These relationships were subsequently applied to predict male lung cancer morbidity in a specific year. Annual mean PM2.5levels in this specific year and previous 8 years were used as 9 independent variables to establish four statistical models. These models include ridge regression (RR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and the combined forecasting model (CFM) to predict the male lung cancer morbidity in China from 2010 to 2015. The model error evaluations suggested that the partial least squares regression model performed the best in the male lung cancer morbidity forecast. We calculated the male lung cancer morbidity by the optimal method among the established statistical forecasting models at 1948 sites in China. The gridded morbidity distribution from 2010 to 2015 across the country was obtained by Kriging interpolation method. Results showed that the male lung cancer morbidity increased significantly from western to eastern China, except for the far north region. This spatial pattern is in line with the spatial distribution of PM2.5concentration, manifesting a significant relationship between PM2.5concentration level and lung cancer morbidity in Chinese males. © 2017",Han Xiao; Liu Yuqin; Gao Hong; Ma Jianmin; Mao Xiaoxuan; Wang Yuting; Ma Xudong,Key Laboratory for Environmental Pollution Prediction and Control\College of Earth and Environmental Sciences\China; College of Urban and Environmental Science\Peking University\China; Gansu Provincial Cancer Hospital\Lanzhou\China,-,China; Lung cancer; Male; Morbidity; PM2.5; Spatial analysis

440.html,The impact of synoptic circulation on air quality and pollution-related human health in the Yangtze River Delta region,"PM2.5and O3pollution are of concern for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to their adverse impact on human health. In conjunction with a complex distribution of emission sources, the synoptic circulation conditions control the temporal and spatial variability of air pollution levels and hence the pollution-related health burdens. In this study, a long-term synoptic circulation catalogue is developed by applying the automated Lamb weather type method to the ECMWF mean sea level pressure reanalysis for the YRD region during 2013–2016. Ten typical circulation types are examined in relation to the transport pathways and diffusion conditions, and then multi-site surface observations of PM2.5and O3are composited for different circulation conditions. The results show that each circulation type is characterized with distinct air mass origin, diffusion condition and air quality level. The anticyclonic type (Type A) corresponds to the highest regional PM2.5concentration (68.5 μg/m3) due to the subsidence flow and long-range transport, while the westerly types (Types SW, W and NW) correspond to the higher regional maximum daily 8-h running average O3(MDA8 O3) concentration (> 100 μg/m3) due to favorable local meteorological conditions. Regional transport causes an east-high and west-low PM2.5distribution in westerly types but a west-high and east-low PM2.5distribution in easterly types (Types SE, E and NE). In contrast, nearly all the types show an east-high and west-low O3distribution, suggesting the predominated impacts of precursor emissions. By using established exposure-response functions, the health impact assessment (HIA) shows that Type W poses the greatest public health risk with mean daily excess mortality of 77.3 (95% CI: 61.9, 92.6) deaths and O3pollution accounts for approximately 70% of this health burden. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liao Zhiheng; Gao Meng; Sun Jiaren; Fan Shaojia,School of Atmospheric Sciences\Sun Yat-sen University\China; John A.

We investigate key metrics of ecosystem function in five such ecotones at a peatland complex in Western Siberia. Stratigraphic analysis of three cores from one of these transects shows that the ecotone has been dynamic over time with evidence for recent expansion of forested peatland. We observed that the two alternative states for northern boreal peatlands (forested/open) clearly support distinct plant and microbial communities. These in turn drive and respond to a number of feedback mechanisms. This has led to steep ecological gradients across the ecotones. Tree cover was associated with lower water tables and pH, along with higher bulk density, aquatic carbon concentrations, and electrical conductivity. We propose that the conditions found in the forested peatland of Western Siberia make the carbon sink more vulnerable to warmer and drier conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ratcliffe Joshua L.; Creevy Angela; Andersen Roxane; Zarov Evgeny; Gaffney Paul P.J.; Taggart Mark A.; Mazei Yuri; Tsyganov Andrey N.; Rowson James G.; Lapshina Elena D.; Payne Richard J.,Environmental Research Institute\North Highland College\United Kingdom; Science & Engineering\University of Waikato\New Zealand; Geography\Edge Hill University\United Kingdom; Center for Environmental Dynamics and Climate Change\Yugra State University\Russian Federation,-,Carbon; Forest; Mire; Peat; Ryam; Testate amoebae
443.html,"Assessing natural and anthropogenic influences on water discharge and sediment load in the Yangtze River, China","The water discharge and sediment load of rivers are changing substantially under the impacts of climate change and human activities, becoming a hot issue in hydro-environmental research. In this study, the water discharge and sediment load in the mainstream and seven tributaries of the Yangtze River were investigated by using long-term hydro-meteorological data from 1953 to 2013. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and double mass curve (DMC) were used to detect trends and abrupt change-points in water discharge and sediment load and to quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on water discharge and sediment load. The results are as follows: (1) the water discharge showed a non-significant decreasing trend at most stations except Hukou station. Among these, water discharge at Dongting Lake and the Min River basin shows a significant decreasing trend with average rates of − 13.93 × 108m3/year and − 1.8 × 108m3/year (P < 0.05), respectively. However, the sediment load exhibited a significant decreasing trend in all tributaries of the Yangtze River. (2) No significant abrupt change-points were detected in the time series of water discharge for all hydrological stations. In contrast, significant abrupt change-points were detected in sediment load, most of these changes appeared in the late 1980s. (3) The water discharge was mainly influenced by precipitation in the Yangtze River basin, whereas sediment load was mainly affected by climate change and human activities; the relative contribution ratios of human activities were above 70% for the Yangtze River. (4) The decrease of sediment load has directly impacted the lower Yangtze River and the delta region.

444.html,Excessive input of phosphorus significantly affects microbial Fe(III) reduction in flooded paddy soils by changing the abundances and community structures of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae,"Microbial Fe(III) reduction can make an excellent contribution to the bioremediation of contaminated environments and potentially reduce methanogenesis. Excessive input of phosphorus (P) by P fertilizer application and eutrophied irrigation water might have a substantial influence on the process of microbial Fe(III) reduction in flooded paddy soils. To evaluate the effect of P application on microbial Fe(III) reduction, the responses of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae communities to different concentrations of P addition (CK: 0 mmol P kg− 1soil; P1: 3.3 mmol P kg− 1soil; P2: 20 mmol P kg− 1soil) were investigated in anaerobically incubated paddy slurries. P addition significantly inhibited Fe(III) reduction during the early stage of incubation (from days 0 to 20). Compared with the CK treatment, the maximum Fe(III) reduction rate (Vmax) in treatments P1 and P2 remarkably decreased by 0.281 and 0.439 mg·g− 1·d− 1, respectively. However, the addition of P had no significant effect on Fe(III) reduction during the later stage of incubation (after 20 days). The abundances of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae were suppressed by P addition, and the suppression effect was more obvious with higher P concentration. P addition significantly changed the community structures of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae during the entire incubation. The communities of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae were closely correlated with the process of Fe(III) reduction. In conclusion, P addition could inhibit the microbial reduction of Fe(III) during the early stage of incubation by reducing the abundances and altering the community structures of Clostridium and Geobacteraceae, however, the inhibition could be eliminated with increased incubation time. This study demonstrates that soil microbial communities are sensitive to excessive P application, which can jointly impact relevant biogeochemical processes in flooded paddy soils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Lina; Qu Zhi; Jia Rong; Wang Baoli; Wang Yuanyuan; Qu Dong,College of Natural Resources and Environment\Northwest A&F University\China; College of Life Sciences\Northwest A&F University\China,-,Clostridium; Fe(III) reduction; Flooded paddy soil; Geobacteraceae; Phosphorus addition
445.html,Development of a soft extraction method for sulfamethoxazole and transformation products from agricultural soils: Effects of organic matter co-extraction on the environmental availability assessment,"The recycling of biosolids and livestock manure in agriculture may lead to the introduction of antibiotic residues, i.e., parent molecule and transformation products, into amended soils. Their fate in soils can be approached through the assessment of their environmental availability. In this work, the environmental availability of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and three transformation products (N4-acetyl-SMX, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, aniline) was assessed in soils amended with sludge compost or cow manure throughout a three-month incubation, using soft extractions with CaCl2, EDTA or cyclodextrin solutions. First, the freeze-storage of soil samples was shown to decrease the SMX extractability. The SMX extractability depended on the initial concentration, the amendment type and the extracting solution at day 0. From 1.9% up to 63% of the SMX total content was initially extractable. The lowest fractions were quantified in EDTA extracts in which the dissolved organic matter was the most complex and responsible for high matrix effects in mass spectrometry compared to CaCl2extracts. The purification of cyclodextrin extracts highly reduced the matrix effects, but CaCl2was considered as the most suitable extractant. SMX extractability strongly decreased after the first 8 days of incubation to finally reach 0.4–0.8% after 84 days, whatever the initial conditions. This high decrease could be related to humification observed through the increasing complexity of extracted dissolved organic matter. Very low levels of transformation products were quantified throughout the incubation period. The low environmental availability of SMX was mainly due to its sorption on soil organic matter and resulted in its low biotransformation in these amended soils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Goulas Anaïs; Bourdat-Deschamps Marjolaine; Nélieu Sylvie; Jimenez Julie; Patureau Dominique; Haudin Claire-Sophie; Benoit Pierre,UMR ECOSYS\INRA\France; LBE\INRA\France,-,Adsorption; Fluorescence spectrometry; Freely-dissolved fraction; Organic waste product; Sulfonamide
446.html,Microbial association with the dynamics of particulate organic carbon in response to the amendment of elevated CO2-derived wheat residue into a Mollisol,"As the chemical quality of crop residue is likely to be affected by elevated CO2(eCO2), residue amendments may influence soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, in Mollisols, the dynamics of the SOC fractions in response to amendment with wheat residue produced under eCO2and the corresponding microbial community composition remain unknown. Such investigation is essential to residue management, which affects the soil quality and productivity of future farming systems. To narrow this knowledge gap,13C–labeled shoot and root residue derived from ambient CO2(aCO2) or eCO2were amended into Mollisols and incubated for 200 days. The soil was sampled during the incubation period to determine the residue-C retained in the three SOC fractions, i.e., coarse intra-aggregate particulate organic C (coarse iPOC), fine iPOC and mineral-associated organic C (MOC). The soil bacterial community was assessed using a MiSeq sequencing instrument. The results showed that the increase in SOC concentrations attributable to the application of the wheat residue primarily occurred in the coarse iPOC fraction. Compared with the aCO2-derived shoot residue, the amendment of eCO2-derived shoot residue resulted in greater SOC concentrations, whereas no significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the aCO2- and eCO2-derived roots. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the residue amendment significantly (P ≤ 0.05) altered the bacterial community composition compared with the non-residue amendment. Additionally, the bacterial community in the aCO2-derived shoot treatment differed from those in the other residue treatments until day 200 of the incubation period. The eCO2-derived shoot treatment significantly increased (P ≤ 0.05) the relative abundances of the genera Acidobacteriaceae_(Subgroup_1)_uncultured, Bryobacter, Candidatus_Solibacter, Gemmatimonas and Nitrosomonadaceae_uncultured, whereas the opposite trend was observed in Nonomuraea, Actinomadura, Streptomyces and Arthrobacter (P ≤ 0.05). These results imply that the response of the microbial community to the eCO2-derived shoot treatment is associated with its contribution to the POC fractions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Yanhong; Yu Zhenhua; Li Yansheng; Wang Guanghua; Liu Junjie; Liu Judong; Liu Xiaobing; Jin Jian,Key Laboratory of Mollisols Agroecology\Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Centre for AgriBioscience\La Trobe University\Australia,-,Chemical quality; Elevated CO2; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; SOC fractionation; Wheat residue
447.html,"Seasonal variations in the occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances in water, sediment and fish samples from Ebro Delta (Catalonia, Spain)","The main objective of this study was to assess the concentration levels and the seasonal variations of 13 poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in different compartments (water, sediments and fish) of the Ebro Delta (NE Spain) and surrounding coastal areas. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the most frequently detected compound in waters and sediments. Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were the compounds found at the highest concentrations in water samples. On the other hand, sediments were more enriched in perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) (range < 1.02–22.6 ng/g dw). Waters and sediments showed a different seasonal trend. While waters were characterised by a substantial constant level of PFASs over the year, sediments showed a progressive decrease from autumn to summer, revealing the great influence that environmental conditions exert on PFAS distribution in sediments. As regards fish samples, in spite of the ban of its production, PFOS was the most frequently detected compound in seawater fishes, in agreement with its high persistency, bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Moreover, PFASs showed to be more distributed in the skin rather than in muscle tissues. In addition, river fishes were characterised by very high PFAS levels (∑ PFAS range from 63.8 ng/g ww to 938 ng/g ww), with perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids being more concentrated than sulfonates. The PFASs concentrations in water, sediment, and biota revealed that one of the studied sites, Isla de Buda was the most contaminated site of the Ebro Delta. These results are consistent with its location at the final part of the estuary, where many irrigation channels are collected together. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Pignotti Emanuela; Casas Gemma; Llorca Marta; Tellbüscher Anil; Almeida David; Dinelli Enrico; Farré Marinella; Barceló Damià,Department of Biological\Geological and Environmental Sciences\Italy; Water and Soil Quality Research Group\Department of Environmental Chemistry\Spain; Department of Chemistry\University Duisburg-Essen\Germany; GRECO\Institute of Aquatic Ecology\Spain,-,Fish analysis; LC-MS/MS; Mediterranean estuary; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Seasonal variations; Sediment analysis; Water analysis
448.html,Urinary phthalate metabolites over the first 15 months of life and risk assessment – CHECK cohort study,"Phthalates are important group of endocrine disruptors. Infants and young children are susceptible to phthalate exposure. However, information on the phthalate exposure during the early stages of life is very limited. This study was conducted to understand the temporal trend of exposure to major phthalates among infants of Korea during the first 15 months after birth, and to estimate associated risks. A total of 286 urine samples were collected from 171 children at 3, 9, 12, or 15 months of age, with 77 children sampled for two or more times. Four phthalates, i.e., di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were chosen, and their major metabolites were analyzed in the urine. The DEHP metabolites were detected in 100% of the urine samples at relatively higher levels compared to those reported in other countries. The levels of mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) were generally lower. Urinary concentrations of most phthalate metabolites, especially DEHP metabolites, increased as children grew older. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) calculated for DEHP metabolites over time were high (0.7–0.8), suggesting persistence of consistent exposure sources during this sensitive period of life. Hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) were calculated from daily intake estimates divided by recommended toxicity thresholds. Among the study population, 4, 16, and 26% of the children showed HI > 1 at 9, 12, and 15 months of age, respectively. DEHP exposure explained most of the risk estimates. Considering vulnerability of young children to endocrine disruption, efforts to identify sources of exposure and to develop appropriate mitigation options are warranted. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kim Sunmi; Lee Jangwoo; Park Jeongim; Kim Hai-Joong; Cho Geum Joon; Kim Gun-Ha; Eun So-Hee; Lee Jeong Jae; Choi Gyuyeon; Suh Eunsook; Choi Sooran; Kim Sungjoo,School of Public Health\Seoul National University\South Korea; College of Natural Sciences\Soonchunhyang University\South Korea; College of Medicine\Korea University\South Korea; College of Medicine\Soonchunhyang University\South Korea,-,Infant; Phthalates; Repeated measurement; Trend; Urine; Within-subject variation
449.html,Arsenic speciation in aquifer sediment under varying groundwater regime and redox conditions at Jianghan Plain of Central China,"At Jianghan Plain of central Yangtze basins where the health of > 73, 000 people has been affected by long term intake of high arsenic groundwater, over 100 sediment samples from four boreholes at the field monitoring sites were collected and analyzed to delineate the distribution and speciation of As in the shallow aquifer sediment. Results showed that sediment As concentration is generally dependent on the lithological conditions, with the higher As concentration present in fine particle sediment, especially in the silty sand layers underlying clay or silty clay layers. High As concentration in the sediment mainly occurred in three different depth ranges: < 5 m, 15–35 m, and > 35 m. Both the groundwater regime and redox conditions played important roles in controlling sediment As speciation. Arsenate (86%) was the dominated As species in the near surface sediment. As the redox turned to be reducing, arsenite (64%) became the dominant species in the underlying clay and silty clay layers. But in the silty sand aquifer near the boundary of unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer, arsenate (85%) became the dominant species again as results of redox potential elevation. In the deep medium to coarse sand aquifers (> 35 m deep), As-sulfides (49%–63%) were the main species of As. The speciation and reactivity of sediment As strongly controlled the spatial distribution of groundwater As concentration, while seasonal variation in groundwater As concentration and speciation affected the content and speciation of sediment As. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Duan Yanhua; Gan Yiqun; Wang Yanxin; Liu Chongxuan; Yu Kai; Deng Yamin; Zhao Ke; Dong Chuangju,School of Environmental Studies\China University of Geosciences\China; State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology\China University of Geosciences\China; School of Environmental Science and Engineering\Southern University of Science and Technology\China; Geological Survey\China University of Geosciences\China,-,Arsenic pollution; Central Yangtze basins; Mobility; Redox controls; Speciation

450.html,Fertilizer efficiency in wheat is reduced by ozone pollution,"Inefficient use of fertilizers by crops increases the risk of nutrient leaching from agro-ecosystems, resulting in economic loss and environmental contamination. We investigated how ground-level ozone affects the efficiency by which wheat used applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer to produce grain protein (NEP, N efficiency with respect to protein yield) and grain yield (NEY, N efficiency with respect to grain yield) across a large number of open-top chamber field experiments. Our results show significant negative ozone effects on NEPand NEY, both for a larger data set obtained from data mining (21 experiments, 70 treatments), and a subset of data for which stomatal ozone flux estimates were available (7 experiments, 22 treatments). For one experiment, we report new data on N content of different above-ground plant fractions as well as grain K and P content. Our analysis of the combined dataset demonstrates that the grain yield return for a certain investment in N fertilizer is reduced by ozone. Results from the experiment with more detailed data further show that translocation of accumulated N from straw and leaves to grains is significantly and negatively affected by ozone, and that ozone decreases fertilizer efficiency also for K and P. As a result of lower N fertilization efficiency, ozone causes a risk of increased N losses from agroecosystems, e.g. through nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions, a hitherto neglected negative effect of ozone. This impact of ozone on the N cycle implies that society is facing a dilemma where it either (i) accepts increased N pollution and counteracts ozone-induced yield reductions by increasing fertilization or (ii) counteracts N pollution under elevated ozone by reducing fertilization, accepting further yield loss adding to the direct effect of ozone on yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Broberg Malin C.; Uddling Johan; Mills Gina; Pleijel Håkan,University of Gothenburg\Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences\Sweden; Centre for Ecology & Hydrology\Environment Centre Wales\United Kingdom,-,Nitrogen; Nitrogen translocation; O3; Phosphorus; Potassium; Triticum aestivum
451.html,A new method for correlation analysis of compositional (environmental) data – a worked example,"Most data in environmental sciences and geochemistry are compositional. Already the unit used to report the data (e.g., μg/l, mg/kg, wt%) implies that the analytical results for each element are not free to vary independently of the other measured variables. This is often neglected in statistical analysis, where a simple log-transformation of the single variables is insufficient to put the data into an acceptable geometry. This is also important for bivariate data analysis and for correlation analysis, for which the data need to be appropriately log-ratio transformed. A new approach based on the isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation, leading to so-called symmetric coordinates, is presented here. Summarizing the correlations in a heat-map gives a powerful tool for bivariate data analysis. Here an application of the new method using a data set from a regional geochemical mapping project based on soil O and C horizon samples is demonstrated. Differences to ‘classical’ correlation analysis based on log-transformed data are highlighted. The fact that some expected strong positive correlations appear and remain unchanged even following a log-ratio transformation has probably led to the misconception that the special nature of compositional data can be ignored when working with trace elements. The example dataset is employed to demonstrate that using ‘classical’ correlation analysis and plotting XY diagrams, scatterplots, based on the original or simply log-transformed data can easily lead to severe misinterpretations of the relationships between elements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Geological Survey of Norway\P.O.·Box 6315\Norway; Institute of Statistics and Mathematical Methods in Economics\Vienna University of Technology\Austria; Department of Mathematical Analysis and Applications of Mathematics\Palacký University\Czech Republic; Emeritus Scientist\Geological Survey of Canada\Canada,-,CoDa; Compositional data analysis; Correlation; Log-ratio methodology; Scatterplot
452.html,Chromium (VI) adsorption from wastewater using porous magnetite nanoparticles prepared from titanium residue by a novel solid-phase reduction method,"Porous magnetite nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by reduction of titanium residue with pyrite under nitrogen protection, and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, zeta potential and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of porous magnetite nanoparticles with single spinel structure. The SEM image demonstrated that porous magnetite nanoparticles displayed spherical shape with the average diameter of ~ 51 nm. The surface area of porous magnetite nanoparticles with high magnetic moment (78 emu·g− 1) was 11.1 m2g− 1. The experimental results revealed that equilibrium adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) was well described by Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 14.49 mg g− 1at 298.15 K, and kinetic data was found to fit well with pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption rate for Cr(VI) was controlled by both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. Thermodynamics analysis showed that the adsorption processes of Cr(VI) were endothermic and spontaneous. In addition, the adsorption of Cr(VI) on porous magnetite nanoparticles was classified as chemisorption adsorption, which depended on electrostatic attraction accompanied with reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Porous magnetite nanoparticles were readily regenerated and used repeatedly for Cr(VI) adsorption at least five cycles. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that porous magnetite nanoparticles have a promising application for Cr(VI) adsorption from wastewater. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ren Genkuan; Wang Xinlong; Huang Penghui; Zhong Benhe; Zhang Zhiye; Yang Lin; Yang Xiushan,College of Chemical Engineering\Sichuan University\China; College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\Yibin University\China,-,adsorption capacity; Cr(VI); porous magnetite nanoparticles; reduction method; titanium residue
453.html,Roadside verges as habitats for endangered lizard-orchids (Himantoglossum spp.): Ecological traps or refuges?,"Alterations in traditional land use practices have led to severe declines in the area of semi-natural grasslands, thereby seriously threatening plant and animal species dependent on these habitats. Small anthropogenic managed habitats, like roadsides can act as refuges and might play an important role in conserving these species. Colonization of roadside verges by endangered lizard orchids (Himantoglossum spp.) has long been known, but few studies have systematically explored the suitability of roadside habitats for these orchids and the impact of roads on them. In this paper we present results of targeted surveys of three lizard orchid taxa on roadsides from eight European countries. During these surveys we searched for lizard orchids inhabiting roadside verges and recorded their distance from road, aspects of the roadside environment, as well as vegetative and reproductive characteristics of individual plants. We found large numbers of lizard orchids on roadside verges. Distance from roads was not uniformly distributed: orchids occurred more closely to roads than expected by chance. This suggests that regular management of roadsides (e.g. mowing) might enhance colonization and survival of lizard orchids. On the other hand, we also found that close proximity to roads negatively affects reproductive success, suggesting that the immediate vicinity of roads might act as an ecological trap (i.e. favorable in terms of colonization and survival but unfavorable in terms of reproduction). Nonetheless, the fact that significant and viable populations are maintained at roadsides suggests that traditionally managed roadside verges may allow long-term persistence of lizard orchid populations and may serve as refuges in a landscape context. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fekete Réka; Nagy Timea; Bódis Judit; Biró Éva; Löki Viktor; Süveges Kristóf; Takács Attila; Tökölyi Jácint; Molnár V.

454.html,Application of kinetic modeling to predict the fate of two indoxacarb metabolites and their bound residues in soil,"Insecticide indoxacarb metabolites JT333 and MP819 were used as model compounds to assess the utilization of kinetic modeling to elucidate metabolic pathways, determine degradation kinetics of non-extractable residues (NER) and predict the accumulation potential of the released NER in soil. Soil adsorption coefficients and degradation product formation were determined in different soils in laboratory. Inverse kinetic modeling was applied to explore the dynamics of dissipation of parent (P), formation of extractable metabolites (MET), NER and CO2, and to identify their routes of degradation in soil. These two compounds share similar structural characteristics, have high affinity to soil (Koc> 5000 L/kg), short half-life (DT50of 4–9 days), and significant CO2formation in soil. However, kinetic modeling showed that they degraded via different pathways. The P-MET-CO2conversion route was the major degradation pathway for JT333 in aerobic soil. Multiple pathways were involved in MP819 degradation, while the formation of NER was predominant. The time-exposure area under the curves (AUC) for the MET or NER in soils were derived from the time-%concentration plots for the evaluation of rate limiting steps in their degradation pathways. In P-MET-CO2pathway the MET-CO2conversion is the rate limiting step for both compounds. Higher P-MET conversion/MET-CO2conversion rate constant ratio resulted in larger MET AUC. The rate of NER degradation appeared much slower compared to the rates of P-MET and MET-CO2conversions, likely due to the rate-limiting step of NER release from the bound-state, indicating that in this situation the free-state NER would be unlikely to accumulate in soil. The study reported here demonstrates the utility of kinetic modeling to quantify the dynamics of NER formation/dissipation vs. P-MET-CO2conversion, and the application of kinetic modeling to predict the possibility of free-sate NER accumulation in soil, therefore, reveals the potential for the quantitative NER environmental risk assessment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Minli; Whiting Sara A.; Clark Brett J.,E.

455.html,Nitrogen deposition has minor effect on soil extracellular enzyme activities in six Chinese forests,"Soil extracellular enzymes play a key role in mediating a range of forest ecosystem functions (i.e., carbon and nutrients cycling and biological productivity), particularly in the face of atmospheric N deposition that has been increasing at an unprecedented rate globally. However, most studies have focused only on surface soils in a single ecosystem. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the effect of simulated N deposition on the activities and ratios of soil enzymes changes with soil depth across six forest ecosystems in eastern China. We collected soil samples from three blocks × four soil depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–60 cm) × three N treatment levels (control, 50 and 100 kg N ha− 1year− 1) at each of the six forest ecosystems. We measured the activities of seven soil enzymes involved in C-, N- and P-cycling. We found that 4–5 years of N addition had no significant effect on the activities and ratios of these enzymes in most cases. The interactions among N addition, site and soil depth on soil enzyme activities were not significant, except that acid phosphatase activity showed site-specific responses to N addition. Our findings suggest that the activities of soil enzymes involved in C- and N-cycling generally do not track simulated N deposition in the six forest ecosystems. Further work on plant, soil and microbial characteristics is needed to better understand the mechanisms of soil enzyme activities in response to N deposition in forest ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Jing Xin; Chen Xiao; Tang Mao; Ding Zongju; Jiang Lai; Li Peng; Ma Suhui; Tian Di; Xu Longchao; Zhu Jianxiao; Ji Chengjun; Shen Haihua,Department of Ecology\College of Urban and Environmental Sciences\China; School of Urban Planning and Design\Shenzhen Graduate School\China; State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change\Institute of Botany\China,-,Decomposition; Forest ecosystem; Nitrogen deposition; Nutrient cycling; Soil enzyme; Stoichiometry

We determined14C and13C carbon isotope values for both DIC and DOC in groundwaters, and investigated the composition of DOC throughout the aquifer. In combination with hydrochemical and3H measurements, the chemical evolution of groundwaters was then traced from the unsaturated zone to the deeper saline zone. The data revealed three distinct water types: Fresh (F), Transition zone 1 (T1) and Transition zone 2 (T2) groundwaters. The3H values in F and T1 samples indicate that these groundwaters are mostly modern.14CDOCvalues are higher than14CDICvalues and are well correlated with3H values. F and T1 groundwater geochemistry is dominated by carbonate mineral recrystallisation reactions that add dead carbon to the groundwater. T2 groundwaters are deeper, saline and characterised by an absence of3H, lower14CDOCvalues and a different DOC composition, namely a higher proportion of Humic Substances relative to total DOC. The T2 groundwaters are suggested to result from either the slow circulation of water within the seawater wedge, or from old remnant seawater caused by past sea level highstands. While further investigations are required to identify the origin of the T2 groundwaters, this study has identified their occurrence and shown that they did not evolve along the same pathway as fresh groundwaters. This study has also shown that a combined approach using14C and13C carbon isotope values for both DIC and DOC and the composition of DOC, as well as hydrochemical and3H measurements, can provide invaluable information regarding the transformation of carbon in a groundwater system and the evolution of fresh groundwater recharge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bryan Eliza; Meredith Karina T.; Baker Andy; Andersen Martin S.; Post Vincent E.A.,Connected Waters Initiative Research Centre\UNSW\Australia; Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation\Lucas Heights\Australia; School of Biological Earth and Environmental Sciences\UNSW\Australia; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering\UNSW\Australia,-,Carbon isotopes; Dissolved inorganic and organic carbon; Radiocarbon; Recrystallisation; Seawater intrusion
457.html,"Effect of temperature on sulfonamide antibiotics degradation, and on antibiotic resistance determinants and hosts in animal manures","Animal manure is a main reservoir of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance. Here, the effect of temperature on sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs), sulfonamide-resistant (SR) genes/bacteria was investigated by aerobically incubating swine and chicken manures at different temperatures. In swine manure, the SAs concentration declined with increasing temperature, with a minimum at 60 °C. In chicken manure, the greatest degradation of SAs was noted at 30 °C. The reduction of relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and sul-positive hosts in swine manure was more pronounced during thermophilic than mesospheric incubation; neither temperature conditions effectively reduced these parameters in chicken manure. The relationship between the residual levels/distribution profiles of SAs, ARGs (sul1, sul2 and intI1), cultivable SR bacteria and sul-positive hosts was further established. The antibiotic residual profile, rather than antibiotic concentration, acted as an important factor in the prevalence of ARGs and sul-positive hosts in manure. Corynebacterium and Leucobacter from the phylum Actinobacteria tend to be main carriers of sul1 and intI1; the relative abundance of sul2 was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of cultivable SR bacteria. Overall, differences in resistant bacterial communities also constitute a dominant factor affecting ARG variation.

458.html,Assessment of the municipal water cycle in China,"Water produced from municipal utilities accounts for nearly 10% of the sum water demand in China. The municipal water cycle that integrates processes of urban water supply, water use, sewage treatment, and water reclamation has been assessed for 655 cities across nine drainage areas in mainland China in 2012. These cities in total extracted 55 km3raw water for municipal use from surface waterbodies and ground aquifers, approximate to the countrywide freshwater extraction of Russia or Italy. After purification and transmission, 45 km3water was distributed to industrial, service, and domestic users. 36 km3of post-use sewage was collected and environmentally safely treated; merely 3.2 km3of the treated water was reclaimed. Driven by increasing urbanization, the municipal water demand in cities of China may grow 70% by 2030. The Hai River and the Huai River basins, which harbor 137 cities and occupy a majority of the densely populated North China Plain, are most exposed to physical water scarcity. The municipal water abstraction in these cities can remain constant by promoting demand-side and process conservation in the next two decades. Interbasin transfer and unconventional sources will provide municipal water double than the cities' need. Whereas the urban water security can be technically enhanced, the challenges are to better improve water use efficiency and mitigate economic and environmental costs of the municipal system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Tao; Liu Shuming; Qian Xuepeng; Shimizu Toshiyuki; Dente Sébastien M.R.; Hashimoto Seiji; Nakajima Jun,Global Innovation Research Organization\Ritsumeikan University\Japan; Circular Economy Research Institute\Tongji University\China; Institute of Science and Technology for Development of Shandong Province\Shandong Academy of Sciences\China; School of Environment\Tsinghua University\China,-,Municipal water cycle; Process water loss; Reclaimed water; Scenario analysis; Water efficiency; Water scarcity

Although the presence of these contaminants of emerging concern is frequently reported to be present throughout the environment, their presence in wastewater treatment plants has been seldom studied. Of the 18 compounds investigated in this study, imidacloprid was the only compound not detected in all three WWTPs. Concentrations measured ranged from 3 ng/L to 27 μg/L for fluconazole. The yeast estrogenic and yeast androgenic screen assays were performed on target compounds in order to investigate their endocrine disruption and potential environmental risks to receiving waters. It was found that of the 14 compounds investigated 12 showed either antiestrogenic or antiandrogenic activity and seven compounds showed pleiotropic effects. In addition to confirming endocrine activities of pesticides using the yeast-based assays this study is one of the first to report activities for novel compounds including three neonicotinoids. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Westlund Paul; Yargeau Viviane,Department of Chemical Engineering\McGill University\Canada,-,Endocrine disruption; In-vitro bioassays; Pesticides; Wastewater

However, little attention has been paid to the combined effects of PM and air pollutants on the cardiovascular system. To explore this, a high-throughput sequencing technology was used to determine combined effects of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and MeHg in zebrafish. Our study demonstrated that SiNPs and MeHg co-exposure could cause significant changes in mRNA and miRNA expression patterns in zebrafish. The differentially expressed (DE) genes in profiles 17 and 26 of STC analysis suggest that SiNPs and MeHg co-exposure had more proinflammatory and cardiovascular toxicity in zebrafish than single exposure. Major gene functions associated with cardiovascular system in the co-exposed zebrafish were discerned from the dynamic-gene-network, including stxbp1a, celf4, ahr1b and bai2. In addition, the prominently expressed pathway of cardiac muscle contraction was targeted by 3 DE miRNAs identified by the miRNA-pathway-network (dre-miR-7147, dre-miR-26a and dre-miR-375), which included 23 DE genes. This study presents a global view of the combined SiNPs and MeHg toxicity on the dynamic expression of both mRNAs and miRNAs in zebrafish, and could serve as fundamental research clues for future studies, especially on cardiovascular system toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hu Hejing; Shi Yanfeng; Zhang Yannan; Wu Jing; Asweto Collins Otieno; Feng Lin; Yang Xiaozhe; Duan Junchao; Sun Zhiwei,Department of Toxicology and Sanitary Chemistry\School of Public Health\China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology\Capital Medical University\China,-,Cardiovascular system; Combined toxicity; MeHg; SiNPs; Transcriptional analysis

In ice core research methanesulfonic acid is the chemical marker commonly used for assessing changes in past primary production. However, other organic compounds such as amino acids, can be produced and emitted into the atmosphere during a phytoplankton bloom. These species can be transported and deposited onto the ice cap in polar regions. Here we investigate the correlation between the concentration of chlorophyll-a, marker of marine primary production, and amino acids present in an ice core. For the first time, free L- and D-amino acids in Arctic snow and firn samples were determined by a sensitive and selective analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The new method for the determination of free amino acids concentrations was applied to firn core samples collected on April 2015 from the summit of the Holtedahlfonna glacier, Svalbard (N 79′08.424, E 13′23.639, 1120 m a.s.l.). The main results of this work are summarized as follows: (1) glycine, alanine and proline, were detected and quantified in the firn core samples; (2) their concentration profiles, compared with that of the stable isotope δ18O ratio, show a seasonal cycling with the highest concentrations during the spring and summer time; (3) back-trajectories and Greenland Sea chlorophyll-a concentrations obtained by satellite measurements were compared with the amino acids profile obtained from ice core samples, this provided further insights into the present results. This study suggests that the amino acid concentrations in the ice samples collected from the Holtedahlfonna glaciers could reflect changes in oceanic phytoplankton abundance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Barbaro Elena; Spolaor Andrea; Karroca Ornela; Park Ki-Tae; Martma Tõnu; Isaksson Elisabeth; Kohler Jack; Gallet Jean Charles; Bjorkman Mats P.; Cappelletti David; Spreen Gunnar; Zangrando Roberta,Department of Environmental Sciences\Informatics and Statistics\Italy; Institute for the Dynamics of Environmental Processes CNR\Via Torino 155\Italy; Korea Polar Research Institute\26 Songdomirae-ro\South Korea; Department of Geology\Tallinn University of Technology\Estonia,-,Amino acids; Biological marker; Ice cores; Svalbard
464.html,Sector-wise midpoint characterization factors for impact assessment of regional consumptive and degradative water use,"Water availability, resulting from either a lack of water or poor water quality is a key factor contributing to regional water stress. This study proposes a set of sector-wise characterization factors (CFs), namely consumptive and degradative water stresses, to assess the impact of water withdrawals with a life cycle assessment approach. These CFs consider water availability, water quality, and competition for water between domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors and ecosystem at the watershed level. CFs were applied to a case study of regional water management of industrial water withdrawals in Taiwan to show that both regional or seasonal decrease in water availability contributes to a high consumptive water stress, whereas water scarcity due to degraded water quality not meeting sector standards has little influence on increased degradative water stress. Degradative water stress was observed more in the agricultural sector than in the industrial sector, which implies that the agriculture sector may have water quality concerns. Reducing water intensity and alleviating regional scale water stresses of watersheds are suggested as approaches to decrease the impact of both consumptive and degradative water use. The results from this study may enable a more detailed sector-wise analysis of water stress and influence water resource management policies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lin Chia-Chun; Lin Jia-Yu; Lee Mengshan; Chiueh Pei-Te,Graduate Institute of Environmental Engineering\College of Engineering\Taiwan,-,Agricultural water use; Characterization factor; Impact assessment; Industrial water use; Water stress; Water withdrawals

The present analysis focusses on the cumulative green roof net ecosystem exchange of CO2(NEE), on its seasonal variation and on green roof physiological characteristics by applying a canopy (A-gs) model. The green roof was a carbon sink with an annual cumulative NEE of − 313 g CO2m− 2year−1, equivalent to − 85 g C m− 2year−1. Three established CO2flux gap-filling methods were applied to estimate NEE and to study the performance during different meteorological situations. A best estimate NEE time series was established, which chooses the gap filling method with the highest performance. During dry periods daytime carbon uptake was shown to decline linearly with substrate moisture below a threshold of 0.05 m3m− 3, whereas night-time respiration was unaffected by substrate moisture variation. The roof turned into a temporary C source during dry conditions in summer 2015. We conclude that the carbon uptake of the present green roof can be optimized when substrate moisture is kept above 0.05 m3m− 3. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Heusinger Jannik; Weber Stephan,Climatology and Environmental Meteorology\Institute of Geoecology\Germany,-,A-gs model; Carbon sequestration; CO2uptake; Dry periods; Urban

The nutrient biochar believed to enhance crop yield and soil fertility than structural biochar that may offset the positive effect of chemical fertilizer on crop performance but improves soil structural properties. Therefore, we investigated the effect of biochars [produced from nutrient rich feedstocks like poultry manure (PMB) and farmyard manure (FMB) and structural feedstocks such as wood chips (WCB) and kitchen waste (KWB)], and chemical fertilizers (CF) when applied alone or in combination on soil chemical properties, wheat growth, yield and nitrogen uptake in a cultivated clay loam soil. Sole biochar treatments increased the total carbon and mineral nitrogen content that were 21 and 106% higher, respectively compared to control after 128 days (P < 0.001). Contrarily, sole biochars application did not increase wheat biological yield and N uptake compared to control (P > 0.05) except PMB, the nutrient biochar (P < 0.05). Compared to control, grain yield was 6 and 12% lower in WCB and FMB, respectively but not differed from KWB, PMB or WCB-CF. Conversely, co-application of biochars and CF treatments increased crop biological yield but the increment was the highest in nutrient biochars FMB or PMB (29 or 26%), than structural biochars WCB and KWB (15 and 13%), respectively (P < 0.05). For N uptake, this increment varies between 16 and 27% and again nutrient biochar has significantly higher N uptake than structural biochars. Hence, nutrient biochars (i.e. PMB) benefited the soil fertility and crop productivity more than structural biochars. Therefore, for immediate crop benefits, it is recommended to use nutrient biochar alone or in combination with chemical fertilizer. Such practice will improve crop performance and the quality of cultivated soil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sadaf Jawaria; Shah Ghulam Abbas; Shahzad Khurram; Ali Nadeem; Shahid Muhammad; Ali Safdar; Hussain Rai Altaf; Ahmed Zammurad Iqbal; Traore Bouba; Ismail Iqbal M.I.; Rashid Muhammad Imtiaz,Department of Agronomy\PMAS-Arid Agriculture University\Pakistan; Center of Excellence in Environmental Studies\King Abdulaziz University\Saudi Arabia; Department of Environmental Sciences\COMSATS Institute of Information Technology\Pakistan; Department of Chemistry\Faculty of Science\Saudi Arabia,-,Animal waste; Biochar; Carbon storage; Crop performance; Kitchen waste; Mineral N

The experimental parameters were optimized and the mechanism involved was also determined. The AgNP/H2O2process proved efficacious for bromide and chloride removal from water through the selective precipitation of AgCl and AgBr on the AgNP surface. The optimal AgNP and H2O2concentrations to be added to the solution were determined for the halide concentrations under study. The removal of Cl−and Br−anions was more effective at basic pH, reaching values of up to 100% for both ions. The formation of OH[rad], O2[rad]−, radicals was detected during the oxidation of Ag(0) into Ag(I), determining the reaction mechanism as a function of solution pH. Moreover, the results obtained show that: i) the efficacy of the oxidation of Ag(0) into Ag(I) is higher at pH 11, ii) AgNPs can be generated by the O2[rad]−radical formation, and iii) the presence of NaCl and dissolved organic matter (tannic acid [TAN]) on the solution matrix reduces the efficacy of bromide removal from the medium due to: i) precipitation of AgCl on the AgNP surface, and ii) the radical scavenger capacity of TAN. AgNPs exhausted can be regenerated by using UV or solar light, and toxicity test results show that AgNPs inhibit luminescence of Vibrio fischeri bacteria. © 2017",-,Department of Inorganic Chemistry\Faculty of Science\Spain; Eawag\Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology\Switzerland; EPFL\École Polytechnique Féderale de Lausanne\Switzerland,-,Halides; Hydroxyl radicals; Precipitation; Silver-nanoparticles
469.html,Ecosystem services response to urbanization in metropolitan areas: Thresholds identification,"Ecosystem service is the key comprehensive indicator for measuring the ecological effects of urbanization. Although various studies have found a causal relationship between urbanization and ecosystem services degradation, the linear or non-linear characteristics are still unclear, especially identifying the impact thresholds in this relationship. This study quantified four ecosystem services (i.e. soil conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen production, water yield, and food production) and total ecosystem services (TES), and then identified multiple advantageous area of ecosystem services in the peri-urban area of Beijing City. Using piecewise linear regression, the response of TES to urbanization (i.e., population density, GDP density, and construction land proportion) and its thresholds were detected. The results showed that, the TES was high in the north and west and low in the southeast, and there were seven multiple advantageous areas (distributed in the new urban development zone and ecological conservation zone), one single advantageous area (distributed in the ecological conservation zone), and six disadvantageous areas (mainly distributed in the urban function extended zone). TES response to population and economic urbanization each had a threshold (229 person km− 2and 107.15 million yuan km− 2, respectively), above which TES decreased rapidly with intensifying urbanization. However, there was a negative linear relationship between land urbanization and TES, which indicated that the impact of land urbanization on ecosystem services was more direct and effective than that of population and economic urbanization. It was also found that the negative impact of urbanization on TES was highest in the urban function extended zone, followed in descending order by that in the new urban development zone and ecological conservation zone. According to the detected relationships between urbanization and TES, the economic and population urbanization should be strengthened accompanied by slowing or even reducing land urbanization, so as to achieve urban ecological sustainability with less ecosystem services degradation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Peng Jian; Tian Lu; Liu Yanxu; Zhao Mingyue; Hu Yi'na; Wu Jiansheng,Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes\Ministry of Education\China; Key Laboratory for Environmental and Urban Sciences\School of Urban Planning and Design\China,-,Beijing City; Ecosystem services; Peri-urban area; Piecewise linear regression; Urbanization thresholds

470.html,"Effects of land use and climate change on ecosystem services in Central Asia's arid regions: A case study in Altay Prefecture, China","The sustainable use of ecosystem services (ES) can contribute to enhancing human well-being. Understanding the effects of land use and climate change on ES can provide scientific and targeted guidance for the sustainable use of ES. The objective of this study was to reveal the way in which land use and climate change influence the spatial and temporal variations of ES in the mountain-oasis-desert system (MODS). In this study, we assessed water yield, soil conservation, crop production, and sand fixation in 1990, 2000, and 2010 in Altay Prefecture, which is representative of the MODS, based on widely used biophysical models. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of different land use and climate change conditions on ES. The results show that the area of forest and bare land decreased in Altay Prefecture. In contrast, the area of grassland with low coverage and cropland increased. The climate of this area presented an overall warming-wetting trend, with warming-drying and cooling-wetting phenomena in some areas. Soil conservation in the mountain zone, water yield in the oasis zone, and sand fixation in the desert zone all decreased under the influence of land use change alone. The warming-drying trend led to decreased water yield in the oasis zone and increased wind erosion in the desert zone. Based on the results, we recommend that local governments achieve sustainable use of ES by planting grasslands with high coverage in the oasis zone, increasing investment in agricultural science and technology, and establishing protected areas in the mountain and desert zones. The methodology in our study can also be applied to other regions with a MODS structure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fu Qi; Li Bo; Hou Ying; Bi Xu; Zhang Xinshi,College of Resources Science & Technology\Faculty of Geographical Science\China; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; Institute of Botany\Chinese Academy of Sciences\China,-,Central Asia's arid regions; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Mountain-oasis-desert system
471.html,The impact of prenatal perfluoroalkyl substances exposure on neonatal and child growth,"Background Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are wildly distributed environmental pollutants. Laboratory mice exposed prenatally to PFASs develop smaller birth weight but are more likely to become obese in adulthood. The evidences in human studies are still inconclusive. Methods The participants were 429 mother-infant pairs from Taiwan Birth Panel Study. These children were followed serially and growth data were collected through face to face interviews and records in Child Healthcare Handbooks until 108 months of age. The age-specific z-scores for weight (WAZ), length/height (LAZ/HAZ) and BMI (BMIAZ) were calculated. PFASs in umbilical cord blood were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Results At birth, perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS) levels were negatively associated with weight and height [per ln unit: adjusted β (95% confidence interval, CI) = − 0.14 (− 0.26, − 0.01) for WAZ and − 0.16 (− 0.31, − 0.02) for LAZ]. However, these adverse impacts diminished as children grow up. When stratified the analysis by gender, the effects of prenatal PFOS exposure were more obvious for girls especially during the time span of 6 to 12 and 12 to 24 months of age [per ln unit: adjusted β (95% CI) = − 0.25 (− 0.47, − 0.04) and − 0.24 (− 0.41, − 0.04) for WAZ, respectively; per ln unit: adjusted β (95% CI) = − 0.33 (− 0.59, − 0.08) and − 0.25 (− 0.45, − 0.05) for BMIAZ, respectively]. Later in the period of 60 to 108 months of age, positive association between prenatal PFOS exposure and girls’ BMI was observed [per ln unit: adjusted β (95% CI) = 0.34 (0.007, 0.68) for BMIAZ]. There was little evidence in these data for a consistent association of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) with any of the indicators. Conclusions Our study had shown that higher prenatal PFOS exposure was associated with decreased fetal growth, but the effects were diminished as children grow up.

472.html,End-user perspective of low-cost sensors for outdoor air pollution monitoring,"Low-cost sensor technology can potentially revolutionise the area of air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor technology. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality are also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end-user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air pollution sensor network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Rai Aakash C.; Kumar Prashant; Pilla Francesco; Skouloudis Andreas N.; Di Sabatino Silvana; Ratti Carlo; Yasar Ansar; Rickerby David,Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE)\Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\United Kingdom; Environmental Flow (EnFlo) Research Centre\Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences\United Kingdom; Department of Planning and Environmental Policy\University College Dublin\Ireland; Joint Research Centre (JRC)\European Commission\Italy,-,Environmental sensing; Human health; Outdoor pollution sensing; Pollution exposure; Real-time exposure

In this study, 11 environmental pollutants from three different chemical classes, including benzophenones, parabens and triclosan were measured in 627 urine samples collected from 209 pregnant women to evaluate exposure and trends as a function of pregnancy stage. Methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben, propylparaben (PrP), butylparaben, 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-3) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone were detected in > 50% samples. The concentrations of BP-1 and BP-3 (Spearman's r = 0.57, p < 0.01) and those of MeP and PrP (Spearman's r = 0.68, p < 0.01) were found to be correlated. The urinary concentrations of BP-1 and BP-3 in the first trimester were significantly higher than those in the second or third trimester (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05).

However, the effects of extreme floods of different return intervals on the floodplain and river channel morphological evolution with the associated sediment transport processes are not well explored. Furthermore, different basin management action plans, such as engineering structure modifications, may also greatly affect the flood inundation, sediment transport, solute transport and morphological processes within extreme flood events. In this study, a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological model is applied to evaluate the impact of different river and basin management strategies on the flood inundation, sediment transport dynamics and morphological changes within extreme flood events of different magnitudes. The 10-year, 50-year, 100-year and 200-year floods are evaluated for the Lower Cache Creek system in California under existing condition and a potential future modification scenario. Modeling results showed that select locations of flood inundation within the study area tend to experience larger inundation depth and more sediment is likely to be trapped in the study area under potential modification scenario. The proposed two dimensional flow and sediment transport modeling approach implemented with a variety of inflow conditions can provide guidance to decision-makers when considering implementation of potential modification plans, especially as they relate to competing management strategies of large water bodies, such as the modeling area in this study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Tu Tongbi; Carr Kara J.; Ercan Ali; Trinh Toan; Kavvas M.

Enhanced supply stability through a reduction in the year-to-year variability of US corn yield would greatly benefit global food security. Important in this regard is to understand how corn yield variability has evolved geographically in the history and how it relates to climatic and non-climatic factors. Results showed that year-to-year variation of US corn yield has decreased significantly during 1980–2010, mainly in Midwest Corn Belt, Nebraska and western arid regions. Despite the country-scale decreasing variability, corn yield variability exhibited an increasing trend in South Dakota, Texas and Southeast growing regions, indicating the importance of considering spatial scales in estimating yield variability. The observed pattern is partly reproduced by process-based crop models, simulating larger areas experiencing increasing variability and underestimating the magnitude of decreasing variability. And 3 out of 11 models even produced a differing sign of change from observations. Hence, statistical model which produces closer agreement with observations is used to explore the contribution of climatic and non-climatic factors to the changes in yield variability. It is found that climate variability dominate the change trends of corn yield variability in the Midwest Corn Belt, while the ability of climate variability in controlling yield variability is low in southeastern and western arid regions. Irrigation has largely reduced the corn yield variability in regions (e.g. Nebraska) where separate estimates of irrigated and rain-fed corn yield exist, demonstrating the importance of non-climatic factors in governing the changes in corn yield variability. The results highlight the distinct spatial patterns of corn yield variability change as well as its influencing factors at the county scale. I also caution the use of process-based crop models, which have substantially underestimated the change trend of corn yield variability, in projecting its future changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Leng Guoyong,Joint Global Change Research Institute\Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\United States,-,Climate change; Crop models; Crop yields; Stability; Statistical models; Variability
476.html,Domestic well locations and populations served in the contiguous U.S.: 1990,"We estimate the location and population served by domestic wells in the contiguous United States in two ways: (1) the “Block Group Method” or BGM, uses data from the 1990 census, and (2) the “Road-Enhanced Method” or REM, refines the locations by using a buffer expansion and shrinkage technique along roadways to define areas where domestic wells exist. The fundamental assumption is that houses (and therefore domestic wells) are located near a named road. The results are presented as two nationally-consistent domestic-well population datasets. While both methods can be considered valid, the REM map is more precise in locating domestic wells; the REM map has a smaller amount of spatial bias (Type 1 and Type 2 errors nearly equal vs biased in Type 1), total error (10.9% vs 23.7%), and distance error (2.0 km vs 2.7 km), when comparing the REM and BGM maps to a calibration map in California. However, the BGM map is more inclusive of all potential locations for domestic wells. Independent domestic well datasets from the USGS, and the States of MN, NV, and TX show that the BGM captures about 5 to 10% more wells than the REM. One key difference between the BGM and the REM is the mapping of low density areas. The REM reduces areas mapped as low density by 57%, concentrating populations into denser regions. Therefore, if one is trying to capture all of the potential areas of domestic-well usage, then the BGM map may be more applicable. If location is more imperative, then the REM map is better at identifying areas of the landscape with the highest probability of finding a domestic well. Depending on the purpose of a study, a combination of both maps can be used. © 2017",Johnson Tyler D.; Belitz Kenneth,United States Geological Survey\California Water Science Center\United States; United States Geological Survey\New England Water Science Center\United States,-,Census; Domestic supply; Drinking water; Private well; Self-supplied; Shallow aquifer

In this study, formation of groundwater with different qualities and saline water intrusion were analyzed using hydrochemical and stable isotopic methods, and the Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram (HFE-Diagram). The results demonstrate that the structure of the sedimentary layer in this area is the dominant controlling factor of groundwater distribution. From the south (land) to the north (sea), the hydrochemical distribution presents a regular changing pattern following the order: HCO3-Na·Mg and HCO3·Cl-Mg·Ca (fresh water), HCO3·Cl-Na·Mg (brackish water), Cl-Na·Mg (saline water), Cl-Na (saline water) and Cl·HCO3-Na (brackish water). Hydrochemical data show that saline water and brine are not the result of evaporation or the concentration of seawater. Brackish water and saline water with low mineralization in Holocene groundwater are formed by the mixing of fresh water and highly mineralized saline water, dissolution of evaporates by meteoric water, and water/salt interaction. And the saline water formed through dissolution of evaporates in Holocene and Late Pleistocene groundwater. Isotopic results reveal that the main recharge of saline water in Holocene groundwater and Late Pleistocene groundwater is a combination of the meteoric water and lateral recharge from rivers. Saline water intrusion was found to follow a wedge-shaped intrusion pattern. Significant variations in Cl-and Na+indicate saline intrusion in the southern area. The degree of saline water intrusion in Holocene groundwater was found to be more serious than that in Late Pleistocene groundwater. Hydrochemical data and HFE-Diagram show that there is an intrusion process in Holocene groundwater. In this process, it is accepted the fresh water recharge, such as meteoric water and lateral recharge from rivers. In Late Pleistocene groundwater, it presents a simple intrusion process from saline water to fresh water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liu Sen; Tang Zhonghua; Gao Maosheng; Hou Guohua,School of Environmental Studies\China University of Geosciences\China; Laboratory for Marine Geology\Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology\China; Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology\CGS\China; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences\Beijing\China,-,Evolutionary process; HFE-Diagram; Hydrochemistry; Saline-water intrusion; Southern Laizhou Bay
479.html,Weathering and evaporation controls on dissolved uranium concentrations in groundwater – A case study from northern Burundi,"The potential use of groundwater for potable water supply can be severely compromised by natural contaminants such as uranium. The environmental mobility of uranium depends on a suite of factors including aquifer lithology, redox conditions, complexing agents, and hydrological processes. Uranium concentrations of up to 734 μg/L are found in groundwater in northern Burundi, and the objective of the present study was to identify the causes for these elevated concentrations. Based on a comprehensive data set of groundwater chemistry, geology, and hydrological measurements, it was found that the highest dissolved uranium concentrations in groundwater occur near the shores of Lake Tshohoha South and other smaller lakes nearby. A model is proposed in which weathering and evapotranspiration during groundwater recharge, flow and discharge exert the dominant controls on the groundwater chemical composition. Results of PHREEQC simulations quantitatively confirm this conceptual model and show that uranium mobilization followed by evapo-concentration is the most likely explanation for the high dissolved uranium concentrations observed. The uranium source is the granitic sand, which was found to have a mean elemental uranium content of 14 ppm, but the exact mobilization process could not be established. Uranium concentrations may further be controlled by adsorption, especially where calcium-uranyl‑carbonate complexes are present. Water and uranium mass balance calculations for Lake Tshohoha South are consistent with the inferred fluxes and show that high‑uranium groundwater represents only a minor fraction of the overall water input to the lake. These findings highlight that the evaporation effects that cause radionuclide concentrations to rise to harmful levels in groundwater discharge areas are not only confined to arid regions, and that this should be considered when selecting suitable locations for water supply wells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR)\Stilleweg 2\Germany; Institut Geographique du Burundi (IGEBU)\Gitega\Burundi,-,Geochemical modelling; Hydrochemistry; Lake Tshohoha South; Public health; Radionuclides; Water supply

Partitioning the role of water column and sediment chemistry as drivers of macroinvertebrate communities in an austral South African stream,"Water pollution is a critical management issue, with many rivers and streams draining urban areas being polluted by the disposal of untreated solid waste and wastewater discharge, storm water and agricultural runoff. This has implications for biodiversity, and many rivers in the developing world are now considered compromised. We investigated benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and composition in relation to physico-chemical conditions of the water column and sediments. The study was conducted in an Austral catchment subject to both urban and agricultural pollutants in two different seasons. We assessed whether sediment characteristics were more important drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition than water column characteristics. We expected clear differences in macroinvertebrate community composition and in the associated community metrics due to distinct flow conditions between the two seasons. A combination of multivariate analyses (canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)) and biological indicator analysis were used to examine these patterns. Chironomidae was the most abundant family (> 60%) in the upper mainstem river and stream sites. Stream sites were positively associated with CCA axis 2, being characterised by high turbidity and lower pH, salinity, phosphate concentration, channel width and canopy cover. Canopy cover, channel width, substrate embeddedness, phosphate concentration, pH, salinity and turbidity all had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate community composition. Using CCA variation partitioning, water quality was, however, a better predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate composition than sediment chemical conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that seasonality had little effect on structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this south-eastern zone of South Africa, despite clear changes in sediment chemistry. This likely reflects the relative lack of major variability in water chemistry compared to sediment chemistry between seasons and the relatively muted variability in precipitation between seasons than the more classic Austral temperate climates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dalu Tatenda; Wasserman Ryan J.; Tonkin Jonathan D.; Mwedzi Tongayi; Magoro Mandla L.; Weyl Olaf L.F.,Zoology and Entomology\Rhodes University\South Africa; School of Science\Monash University Malaysia\Malaysia; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity\P Bag 1015\South Africa; Department of Integrative Biology\Oregon State University\United States,-,Biological indices; Heavy metals; Macroinvertebrates; Sediment chemistry; Water chemistry; Water flow; Water pollution

The efficiency with which it is methylated to mono and dimethyl arsenicals (MMA and DMA) affects toxicity. Folate, vitamins B12 and B6 are required for 1C metabolism, and studies have found that higher levels of these nutrients increase methylation capacity and are associated with protection against adverse health effects from inAs, especially in undernourished populations. Our aim was to determine whether 1C-related nutrients are associated with greater inAs methylation capacity in a general population sample with overall adequate nutrition and low levels of As exposure. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of dietary and blood nutrients to urinary As methylation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2004. Outcome variables were the percent of the sum of inAs and methylated As species (inAs + MMA + DMA) excreted as inAs, MMA, and DMA, and the ratio of MMA:DMA. In univariate models, dietary folate, vitamin B6 and protein intake were associated with lower urinary inAs% and greater DMA% in adults (≥ 18 years), with similar trends in children (6–18). In adjusted models, vitamin B6 intake (p = 0.011) and RBC folate (p = 0.036) were associated with lower inAs%, while dietary vitamin B12 was associated with higher inAs% (p = 0.002) and lower DMA% (p = 0.030). Total plasma homocysteine was associated with higher MMA% (p = 0.004) and lower DMA% (p = 0.003), but not with inAs%; other blood nutrients showed no association with urinary As. Although effect size is small, these findings suggest that 1C nutrients can influence inAs methylation and potentially play an indirect role in reducing toxicity in a general population sample. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kurzius-Spencer Margaret; da Silva Vanessa; Thomson Cynthia A.; Hartz Vern; Hsu Chiu-Hsieh; Burgess Jefferey L.; O'Rourke Mary Kay; Harris Robin B.,Department of Pediatrics\College of Medicine\United States; Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health\University of Arizona\United States; Department of Nutritional Sciences\College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\United States; The University of Arizona Cancer Center\Tucson\United States,-,Arsenic; Dietary; Methylation; NHANES; One-carbon metabolism
482.html,"Occurrence survey and spatial distribution of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl surfactants in groundwater, surface water, and sediments from tropical environments","The occurrence and spatial distribution of 22 selected perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in surface water (n = 75), groundwater (n = 80) and surficial sediment (n = 15) were investigated for the first time in the tropical areas constituted by the French Overseas Territories (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Reunion). Descriptive statistics and correlations between PFASs were evaluated through the use of specific statistical treatments to handle left-censored data (“non-detects”). PFASs were ubiquitous in these samples and detection frequencies as high as 79% for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 65% for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) were reported in surface waters. ∑ PFASs was in the range < LOD–77 ng L− 1(median = 1.8 ng L− 1) in surface waters and < LOD–638 ng L− 1(median = 0.56 ng L− 1) in groundwater. PFOS and PFOA dominated PFAS composition profiles in surface water, while shorter-chain compounds prevailed in groundwater, highlighting their higher transfer potential through infiltration processes and the possible influence of precursors. Elevated levels of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTSA) and short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates were found in groundwater near several industrial facilities such as oil refineries or electricity power plants. This may be related to the existence of firefighting operations involving the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs) that contain precursors to such compounds. These findings would also tend to confirm recent trends regarding the increasing proportion of C4- or C6-based perfluoroalkyl acids, their precursors, or even shorter-chain congeners at PFAS hot spots. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Munoz Gabriel; Labadie Pierre; Botta Fabrizio; Lestremau François; Lopez Benjamin; Geneste Emmanuel; Pardon Patrick; Dévier Marie-Hélène; Budzinski Hélène,Université de Bordeaux\EPOC\France; CNRS\EPOC\France; INERIS\Parc Technologique Alata\France; BRGM\3 avenue Claude Guillemin\France,-,6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate; Groundwater; Industrial sites; Short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids; Source attribution; Surface water
483.html,TREHS: An open-access software tool for investigating and evaluating temporary river regimes as a first step for their ecological status assessment,"When the regime of a river is not perennial, there are four main difficulties with the use of hydrographs for assessing hydrological alteration: i) the main hydrological features relevant for biological communities are not quantitative (discharges) but qualitative (phases such as flowing water, stagnant pools or lack of surface water), ii) stream flow records do not inform on the temporal occurrence of stagnant pools, iii) as most of the temporary streams are ungauged, their regime has to be evaluated by alternative methods such as remote sensing or citizen science, and iv) the biological quality assessment of the ecological status of a temporary stream must follow a sampling schedule and references adapted to the flow- pool-dry regime. To overcome these challenges within an operational approach, the freely available software tool TREHS has been developed within the EU LIFE TRIVERS project. This software permits the input of information from flow simulations obtained with any rainfall-runoff model (to set an unimpacted reference stream regime) and compares this with the information obtained from flow gauging records (if available) and interviews with local people, as well as instantaneous observations by individuals and interpretation of ground-level or aerial photographs. Up to six metrics defining the permanence of water flow, the presence of stagnant pools and their temporal patterns of occurrence are used to determine natural and observed river regimes and to assess the degree of hydrological alteration. A new regime classification specifically designed for temporary rivers was developed using the metrics that measure the relative permanence of the three main phases: flow, disconnected pools and dry stream bed. Finally, the software characterizes the differences between the natural and actual regimes, diagnoses the hydrological status (degree of hydrological alteration), assesses the significance and robustness of the diagnosis and recommends the best periods for biological quality samplings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gallart Francesc; Cid Núria; Latron Jérôme; Llorens Pilar; Bonada Núria; Jeuffroy Justin; Jiménez-Argudo Sara-María; Vega Rosa-María; Solà Carolina; Soria Maria; Bardina Mònica; Hernández-Casahuga Antoni-Josep,Surface Hydrology and Erosion Group\IDAEA\Spain; Freshwater Ecology and Management (FEM) Research Group\Dept.

484.html,Hydrated electron based decomposition of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the VUV/sulfite system,"As one of the most reactive species, hydrated electron (eaq−) is promising for reductive decomposition of recalcitrant organic pollutants, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). In this study, PFOS decomposition using a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)/sulfite system was systematically investigated in comparison with sole VUV and ultraviolet (UV)/sulfite systems. A fast and nearly complete (97.3%) PFOS decomposition was observed within 4 h from its initial concentration of 37.2 μM in the VUV/sulfite system. The observed rate constant (kobs) for PFOS decomposition in the studied system was 0.87 ± 0.0060 h− 1, which was nearly 7.5 and 2 folds faster than that in sole VUV and UV/sulfite systems, respectively. Compared to previously studied UV/sulfite system, VUV/sulfite system enhanced PFOS decomposition in both weak acidic and alkaline pH conditions. In weak acidic condition (pH 6.0), PFOS predominantly decomposed via direct VUV photolysis, whereas in alkaline condition (pH > 9.0), PFOS decomposition was mainly induced by eaq−generated from both sulfite and VUV photolytic reactions. At a fixed initial solution pH (pH 10.0), PFOS decomposition kinetics showed a positive linear dependence with sulfite dosage. The co-presence of humic acid (HA) and NO3−obviously suppressed PFOS decomposition, whereas HCO3–showed marginal inhibition. A few amount of short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were detected in PFOS decomposition process, and a high defluorination efficiency (75.4%) was achieved. These results suggested most fluorine atoms in PFOS molecule ultimately mineralized into fluoride ions, and the mechanisms for PFOS decomposition in the VUV/sulfite system were proposed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gu Yurong; Liu Tongzhou; Wang Hongjie; Han Huili; Dong Wenyi,Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School\Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Water Resource Utilization and Environmental Pollution Control\China,-,Hydrated electron; PFOS; Sulfite; VUV
485.html,The presence of non-native species is not associated with native fish sensitivity to water pollution in greatly hydrologically altered rivers,"There is a risk of ‘ecological surprises’ if multiple potentially interacting stressors are managed individually, which is a question attracting significant current interest. Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km2, 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a ‘base model’ with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Maceda-Veiga Alberto; Mac Nally Ralph; de Sostoa Adolfo,Institute of Research in Biodiversity (IRBio)\University of Barcelona\Spain; Department of Integrative Ecology (EBD-CSIC)\Estación Biológica de Doñana\Spain; Institute for Applied Ecology\University of Canberra\Australia; Department of Ecology\Environment and Evolution\Australia,-,Aquatic invasions; Ecological surprises; Freshwater fish; Hydromorphological alterations; Multiple stressors; Stressor interactions
486.html,Many-objective robust decision making for water allocation under climate change,"Water allocation is facing profound challenges due to climate change uncertainties. To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework was applied to the Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water allocation plans for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water allocation plans for the future (2079–2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water allocation plans to fail under future climate change. Developing robust allocation plans in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yan Dan; Ludwig Fulco; Huang He Qing; Werners Saskia E.,Water Systems and Global Change\Wageningen University & Research\Netherlands; Key Laboratory of Water Cycle and Related Land Surface Processes\Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research\China,-,Climate uncertainties; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Pearl River basin; Robust decision making
487.html,Fit-for-purpose wastewater treatment: Conceptualization to development of decision support tool (I),"This article is the first in a series of two papers. Paper I focuses on model conceptualization and development, and Paper II in the series focuses on model validation and implementation. The amount of water reuse has been increasing across the globe. Wastewater can be treated based on the intended end use of reclaimed water. Fit-for-purpose wastewater treatment (WWT) simultaneously considers intended end use, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. WWT technologies differ mainly in terms of treatment efficiency, cost, energy use, and associated carbon emissions. The planning and evaluation of water reuse projects requires a decision support tool (DST) to evaluate alternative WWT trains and water reuse applications. However, such a DST is not available in the publically accessible literature. A DST, FitWater, has been developed for the evaluation of WWT for various urban reuses. The evaluation is based on the following criteria: amount of reclaimed water production, health risk of water reuse, cost, energy use, and carbon emissions. The cost is estimated as annualized life cycle cost and health risk is estimated using quantitative microbial risk assessment. The uncertainty analysis has been performed using probabilistic and fuzzy-based methods. A multi-criteria decision analysis, using fuzzy weighted average, is employed to aggregate different criteria and generate a final score. FitWater ranks alternative WWT trains based on the resulting final score. The proposed FitWater DST is user-friendly, and its application is demonstrated using an example. The DST can be enhanced to include additional treatment technologies and carbon emissions of different treatment processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chhipi-Shrestha Gyan; Hewage Kasun; Sadiq Rehan,School of Engineering\University of British Columbia\Canada,-,Decision support system; Energy intensity; Fit-for-purpose treatment; Health risk; Life cycle cost; Reclaimed water
488.html,"Profiling of soil volatile organic compounds after long-term application of inorganic, organic and organic-inorganic mixed fertilizers and their effect on plant growth","The complexity of soil processes involved in the production, consumption and accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) makes hard to access the overall dynamics of VOCs in the soil. In this study, the field soil, applied with inorganic (CF), organic (OF) and inorganic-organic mixed (CFOF) fertilizers for ten years was evaluated for the emission of VOCs at different temperature and moisture levels. We identified 30–50 soil emitted VOCs representing the most common soil VOCs groups by using the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The highest total emission of VOCs was found in OF treatment, but it was non-significantly different with CF treatment. The emission of VOCs was significantly increased with the decrease in moisture contents and increase in the temperature of the soil. Among different fertilizer treatments, the emission of VOCs was significantly higher in OF treatment at 5% moisture, and in CF and OF treatments at 35 °C. Further, the VOCs emitted from soil treated with CFOF showed the highest increase in plant growth while CF and OF treatments showed similar results. The VOCs were also extracted from the soil using methanol to better understand the dynamics of VOCs. The abundance of VOCs extracted from the soil was 44–61%, while the richness was 65–70% higher than the VOCs emitted from the soil in different treatments. Taken together the results of emitted and extracted VOCs from the soil, we conclude that the fertilizers are able to discriminate among the VOC patterns of soil. In addition, most of the VOCs are retained in the soil and the emission of VOCs from soil depends on the type of VOCs, soil properties and environmental conditions; however, more research is required to find out better soil VOCs analysis methods. © 2017",Raza Waseem; Mei Xinlan; Wei Zhong; Ling Ning; Yuan Jun; Wang Jichen; Huang Qiwei; Shen Qirong,Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization\Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waste Resource Utilization\China,-,Emitted VOCs; Fertilizers; Microbes; Moisture; Soil properties; Temperature
489.html,Exposure and risk characterization for dietary methylmercury from seafood consumption in Kuwait,"Seafood is an important source of essential nutrients; however, it can also confer health risks from methylmercury (MeHg). In this paper, we evaluate the levels of potential methylmercury exposure among Kuwaiti seafood consumers in order to support the development of dietary recommendations for fish consumption in Kuwait. Total mercury (HgT) concentration for most of the studied fish and shellfish species were on average below the 0.5 μg g− 1Codex guideline. The notable exception to this was Hamoor (Epinephelus coioides), which averaged 1.29 μg g− 1HgT and 0.55 μg g− 1MeHg. A dietary survey of 2393 households demonstrated that large quantities of fish and shellfish are commonly consumed in Kuwait (average consumption: 103 g d− 1). Most participants (53.6%) exceeded the Tolerable Daily Intake of MeHg; this percent exceedance was as high as 78% in children 6–12 years of age. The majority (Mean: 50–51%) of Kuwaiti's dietary MeHg exposure comes from the consumption of Hamoor; therefore, advisories to limit the consumption of Hamoor may be necessary. Nutrient:Methylmercury ratios are reported herein; these ratios may assist efforts to create dietary advice that limits contaminant risk while promoting the nutritional benefits of seafood in Kuwait. © 2017",Laird Brian; Chan Hing Man; Kannan Kurunthachalam; Husain Adnan; Al-Amiri Hanan; Dashti Basma; Sultan Anwar; Al-Othman Amani; Al-Mutawa Faten,School of Public Health and Health Systems\University of Waterloo\Canada; Center for Advanced Research in Environmental Genomics\University of Ottawa (30 Marie-Curie\Canada; Wadsworth Center\New York State Department of Health\United States; Food and Nutrition Program\Environment and Life Sciences Research Center\Kuwait,-,EPA + DHA; Fish; Hamoor; Mercury; Omega-3; Selenium
49.html,The role of civil society in preservation of archaeological heritage in the Republic of Moldova,"In this paper the author is discussing the role of civil society in preservation of the archaeological heritage in Republic of Moldova. Republic of Moldova signed the European Convention on Archaeological Heritage Preservation (revised version) in 1998, ratified it in 2001 and only starting with November 2002 it entered into force. But, the national law on archaeological preservation was voted by Parliament in September 2010 and entered in force in March 2011. So, after a long period of debates and initiatives Republic of Moldova has its own law on this field. The leading role in this process had the National Association of Young Historians of Moldova. This NGO initiated in 2009 an advocacy project in the field of cultural heritage preservation. As main goal and result was the elaboration a new law on archaeological heritage preservation, based on European an International Convention and actual trends in the field of archaeological heritage preservation. © Archaeopress, UISPP and authors 2017.

The composition of these commercial protector products has changed, but there is currently a total dearth of information on these novel fluorinated polymers in the environment. Using a developed analytical approach, two complementary studies examined the distribution of Scotchgard™ fabric protector components in aquatic sediment and in agricultural soils where wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sourced biosolid application occurred, and in samples from sites in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin of North America. The main components in the pre- and post-2002 Scotchgard™ fabric protectors were identified by MS/MS and Q-TOF-MS to contain a perfluorooctane sulfonamide (S1) and perfluorobutane sulfonamide (S2) based side-chain, respectively, and bonded to a polymer backbone. In fifteen sediment samples collected in 2012–2013 from western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), S1 was in all sediment samples (0.18 to 461.59 ng/g dry weight (d.w.)); S2 was in 80% of the sediment samples (< 0.03 to 24.08 ng/g d.w.). Thirteen soil samples were collected (2015) from a biosolid applied and two non-biosolid applied farm field sites in southern Ontario (Canada). S1 was detected in 100% of the soil samples from biosolid-augmented agricultural sites (mean 236.36 ng/g d.w.; range 41.87 to 622.46 ng/g d.w.), and at concentrations much greater than in the aquatic sediment samples. The concentration of S1 and S2 in soil and sediment samples were also much greater than the total concentration of other per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that were measured. The ratio of S1 concentration versus ∑22PFAS concentration was up to 1616 in sediment samples from Lake Erie. This results helps to explain why known PFASs account for low percentages of the total extractable organic fluorine (EOF) content in sediment. © 2017",Chu Shaogang; Letcher Robert J.,Wildlife and Landscape Science Directorate\Science and Technology Branch\Canada,-,LC-MS/MS; Perfluoroalkyl substances; PFASs; Scotchgard™ fabric protector; WWTP
491.html,Fit-for-purpose wastewater treatment: Testing to implementation of decision support tool (II),"This paper is the second in a series of two papers. In Paper I, a decision support tool (DST), FitWater, was developed for evaluating the potential of wastewater treatment (WWT) trains for various water reuse applications. In the present paper, the proposed DST has been tested and implemented. FitWater has been tested with several existing WWT plants in Canada and the USA, demonstrating FitWater's effectiveness in estimating life cycle cost (LCC), health risk, and energy use. FitWater has also been implemented in a newly planned neighbourhood in the Okanagan Valley (BC, Canada) by developing 12 alternative WWT trains for water reuse in lawn and public parks irrigation. The results show that FitWater can effectively rank WWT train alternatives based on LCC, health risk, amount of reclaimed water, energy use, and carbon emissions. Moreover, functions have been developed for the variation of unit annualized LCC and energy intensity per unit log removal of microorganisms in different treatment technologies with varying plant capacities. The functions have power relations, showing the economies of scale. FitWater can be applied to identify a cost-effective, risk-acceptable, and energy efficient wastewater treatment train with a plant capacity of 500 m3/day or more. Furthermore, FitWater can be used to assess potential economic impacts of developing microbiologically stringent effluent standards. The capability of FitWater can be enhanced by including physio-chemical quality of wastewater, additional treatment technologies, and carbon emissions from wastewater decomposition processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chhipi-Shrestha Gyan; Hewage Kasun; Sadiq Rehan,School of Engineering\University of British Columbia\Canada,-,Decision support tool; Energy intensity; Fit-for-purpose wastewater treatment; Health risk; Life cycle cost; Reclaimed water
492.html,Occurrence and temporal variation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in shrimp aquaculture: ARGs dissemination from farming source to reared organisms,"Considerable attention has been paid to the occurrence and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments. However, the temporal variation and dissemination of ARGs in aquaculture environments and reared organisms need further study. This study investigated the abundance and diversity of ARGs and bacterial community in water source, shrimp pond water, sediment, and shrimps during the rearing period in Pearl River Delta region, South China. The results showed that sul1, qnrD, cmlA, and floR were the predominant ARGs in the aquaculture samples. A trend of decreasing abundance of ARGs was observed for pond water samples during the rearing period, whereas an increasing trend was observed in the sediment and shrimp samples. The total concentration of ARGs in water source was significantly higher than that in shrimp pond water (p < 0.05). A significant negative correlation was found between the total concentrations of ARGs in pond waters and sediments (p < 0.01). The total abundances of ARGs in intestinal tract of adult shrimps were 4.48–19.0 times higher than those in juvenile shrimps. Similar to water source and pond water, cmlA and sul1 were the predominant ARGs in shrimp intestinal tract. The bacterial community in the shrimp intestinal tract changed greatly from juvenile to adult. The results of the present study indicated that the abundances of ARGs in aquaculture varied temporally during the rearing period. Water source was an important medium disseminating ARGs to the aquaculture environments and reared organisms. Sul1 could be used as a potential indicator for ARGs in both water and sediment in aquaculture in the estuary of the Pearl River Delta, South China. This study represents a case study for the temporal variation of abundance and dissemination of ARGs in aquaculture and is a reference for potential risks to food safety and human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Su Haochang; Liu Shan; Hu Xiaojuan; Xu Xiangrong; Xu Wujie; Xu Yu; Li Zhuojia; Wen Guoliang; Liu Yousheng; Cao Yucheng,Key Laboratory of South China Sea Fishery Resources Exploitation and Utilization\Ministry of Agriculture\China; State Key Laboratory of Organic Geochemistry\CAS Centre for Pearl River Delta Environmental Pollution and Control Research\China; Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology\South China Sea Institute of Oceanology\China,-,Antibiotic resistance genes; Aquaculture; Bacterial community; Dissemination; Shrimp
493.html,Evaluating the use of in-situ turbidity measurements to quantify fluvial sediment and phosphorus concentrations and fluxes in agricultural streams,"Accurate quantification of suspended sediments (SS) and particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations and loads is complex due to episodic delivery associated with storms and management activities often missed by infrequent sampling. Surrogate measurements such as turbidity can improve understanding of pollutant behaviour, providing calibrations can be made cost-effectively and with quantified uncertainties. Here, we compared fortnightly and storm intensive water quality sampling with semi-continuous turbidity monitoring calibrated against spot samples as three potential methods for determining SS and PP concentrations and loads in an agricultural catchment over two-years. In the second year of sampling we evaluated the transferability of turbidity calibration relationships to an adjacent catchment with similar soils and land cover. When data from nine storm events were pooled, both SS and PP concentrations (all in log space) were better related to turbidity than they were to discharge. Developing separate calibration relationship for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph provided further improvement. However, the ability to transfer calibrations between adjacent catchments was not evident as the relationships of both SS and PP with turbidity differed both in gradient and intercept on the rising limb of the hydrograph between the two catchments. We conclude that the reduced uncertainty in load estimation derived from the use of turbidity as a proxy for specific water quality parameters in long-term regulatory monitoring programmes, must be considered alongside the increased capital and maintenance costs of turbidity equipment, potentially noisy turbidity data and the need for site-specific prolonged storm calibration periods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Stutter Marc; Dawson Julian J.C.; Glendell Miriam; Napier Fiona; Potts Jacqueline M.; Sample James; Vinten Andrew; Watson Helen,The James Hutton Institute\Craigiebuckler\United Kingdom; SEPA\Inverdee House\United Kingdom; Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland\Craigiebuckler\United Kingdom; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA)\Oslo\Norway,-,Concentration behaviour; Loads; Particulate phosphorus; Suspended sediment; Turbidity

Our study population included mothers and their children who participated in a longitudinal birth cohort study that took in place in the Pabna and Sirajdikhan areas of Bangladesh. Anthropometric measures including weight, length, and head circumference were measured at birth, age 12 months, and age 20–40 months. Neurodevelopment was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III) multi-scale at age 20–40 months. A total of 777 mother-child pairs were included. Higher anthropometric measures at 20–40 months were associated with higher cognitive, language, and motor scores on BSID-III. For example, a 1-kg increment in birthweight was associated with an increase of 2.11 for cognitive score (p < 0.0001), 1.63 for language score (p = 0.006), and 0.89 for motor scores (p = 0.03). Greater positive changes in growth parameters, or growth trajectory, between birth and 20–40 months were also associated with higher BSID-III scores. These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders and prenatal exposure to environmental metals. These findings suggest that even when taking into account high environmental metal exposures, prenatal and early childhood growth have strong associations with neurodevelopmental test scores in early childhood. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lee Jane J.; Kapur Kush; Rodrigues Ema G.; Ibne Hasan Md Omar Sharif; Quamruzzaman Quazi; Wright Robert O.; Bellinger David C.; Christiani David C.; Mazumdar Maitreyi,Department of Neurology\Boston Children's Hospital\United States; Department of Environmental Health\Harvard T.H.

495.html,"Cryo-conditioned rocky coast systems: A case study from Wilczekodden, Svalbard","This paper presents the results of an investigation into the processes controlling development of a cryo-conditioned rock coast system in Hornsund, Svalbard. A suite of nested geomorphological and geophysical methods have been applied to characterise the functioning of rock cliffs and shore platforms influenced by lithological control and geomorphic processes driven by polar coast environments. Electrical resistivity tomosgraphy (ERT) surveys have been used to investigate permafrost control on rock coast dynamics and reveal the strong interaction with marine processes in High Arctic coastal settings. Schmidt hammer rock tests, demonstrated strong spatial control on the degree of rock weathering (rock strength) along High Arctic rock coasts. Elevation controlled geomorphic zones are identified and linked to distinct processes and mechanisms, transitioning from peak hardness values at the ice foot through the wave and storm dominated scour zones to the lowest values on the cliff tops, where the effects of periglacial weathering dominate. Observations of rock surface change using a traversing micro-erosion meter (TMEM) indicate that significant changes in erosion rates occur at the junction between the shore platform and the cliff toe, where rock erosion is facilitated by frequent wetting and drying and operation of nivation and sea ice processes (formation and melting of snow patches and icefoot complexes).

Studies of VOCs source profiles from on-road motor vehicles from 2001 to 2016 were summarized in this study, with a focus on the comparisons among different studies and the potential impact of different factors. Generally, non-methane hydrocarbons dominated the source profile of on-road vehicle emissions. Carbonyls, potential important components of vehicle emission, were seldom considered in VOCs emissions of vehicles in the past and should be paid more attention to in further study. VOCs source profiles showed some variations among different studies, and 6 factors were extracted and studied due to their impact to VOCs source profile of on-road vehicles. Vehicle types, being dependent on engine types, and fuel types were two dominant factors impacting VOCs sources profiles of vehicles. In comparison, impacts of ignitions, driving conditions and accumulated mileage were mainly due to their influence on the combustion efficiency. An opening and interactive database of VOCs from vehicle emissions was critically essential in future, and mechanisms of sharing and inputting relative research results should be formed to encourage researchers join the database establishment. Correspondingly, detailed quality assurance and quality control procedures were also very important, which included the information of test vehicles and test methods as detailed as possible. Based on the community above, a better uncertainty analysis could be carried out for the VOCs emissions profiles, which was critically important to understand the VOCs emission characteristics of the vehicle emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hong-li Wang; Sheng-ao Jing; Sheng-rong Lou; Qing-yao Hu; Li Li; Shi-kang Tao; Cheng Huang; Li-ping Qiao; Chang-hong Chen,State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Formation and Prevention of Urban Air Pollution Complex\Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences\China,-,Compositions; On-road vehicle; Review; Source profile; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

As a tool of investigating the effect of various aqueous matrices, as well as, the initial stevioside concentration on the variation of the photocatalytic efficiency, a fully nested experimental design was employed. A significant impact on the degradation rate of the sweetener was observed: degradation rate decreases in the order distilled water > river water > lake water, attributed to the increased natural organic matter content of the respective natural water samples. Moreover, the investigation has involved the identification of intermediate compounds, as well as the assessment of mineralization and toxicity evaluation. More than one hundred unknown transformation products, most of them in the form of several isobaric species, were identified. By employing accurate mass determination, we were able to attribute an empirical formula to each species and through MSnanalyses we were capable to distinguish several isobaric species. The overall transformation mechanism was assessed and involved the hydroxylation/oxidation of the molecule and the subsequent loss of the glucose units bound to the parent compound. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Chemistry\Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry\Greece; Department of Chemistry\Via Giuria 5\Italy; Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences\Via Giuria 5\Italy,-,Experimental design; Intermediates identification; Photocatalysis; Stevioside; Sweeteners

The Doce River was the location of a massive ore tailings dam collapsed in November 2015. Millions of liters of tailings were dumped into the river and reached the continental shelf, causing the country's biggest environmental disaster. We evaluated the As content in sediment of the DRCS before the dam collapse. At both sites, the total As background measured in bottom sediment revealed relative natural enrichment (above 8 mg/kg). Content of As decrease with depth; reactive As showed surficial peaks which were associated with Fe and Mn oxides. The ACS sediment did not show significant enrichment or contamination of As, with an enrichment factor (EF) of approximately 2 and a geoaccumulation index (Igeo) near 0. In contrast, the DRCS exhibited severe As enrichment (EF = 15) and contamination (Igeo between 3–4). This enrichment is attributed to long-term iron and gold exploitation in the Doce River watershed. The high levels of reactive As, up to 108 mg/kg, alert us to an environmental risk due to potential As bioaccessibility. These data provide an important perspective on the As contamination in continental shelves and encourage the monitoring of the ore mine environmental impacts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Oceanographie\University of Espírito Santo State\Brazil; Canada Research Chair in Geochemistry of Hydrogeosystems\Département de Biologie\Canada,-,Arsenic; Continental shelf; Mining; Sediment

Recent investigations have mainly referred to the occurrence and loads of suspended solids, organic compounds and, in some cases, micropollutants. Attempts have been made to find correlations between the discharged load and the size and characteristics of the catchment area, climate conditions, rainfall duration and intensity. This study refers to a touristic coastal area in the north-east of Italy, which is characterized by a combined sewer network including 5 CSO outfalls which, in the case of heavy rain events, directly discharge the exceeding water flow rate into channels which, after a short distance, reach the Adriatic Sea. The study analyzed: i) rainfall events during the summer period in 2014 which led to overflow in the different outfalls, ii) the inter- and intra-event variability with regard to E. coli, Enterococci and conductivity, and iii) the hydraulic and pollutant (E. coli and Enterococci) loads discharged by the local wastewater treatment plant and by all the CSO outfalls. Finally, it estimated the contribution of each source to the released hydraulic and pollutant loads into the receiving water body. Moreover, it was also found that the modest water volume discharged by all CSO outfalls (only 8% of the total volume discharged by the area) contains > 90% of the microbial load. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Engineering\University of Ferrara\Italy; Terra & Acqua Tech\Technopole of the University of Ferrara\Italy,-,Coastal area; Combined sewer overflow; E. coli; Enterococci; Wastewater management and treatment; Wastewater treatment plant effluent

Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand and the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education. © 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

500.html,Coupling life-cycle assessment and the RothC model to estimate the carbon footprint of green manure-based wheat production in China,"Reducing the carbon footprint (CF) of crop production is an efficient way to mitigate climate change. Growing legume green manure (LGM) instead of summer fallow may achieve this goal by lowering synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer needs and replenishing the depleted soil carbon (C) pool. The Rothamsted Carbon (RothC) model was incorporated into the Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the present and projected CFs of green manure-based wheat production systems in dryland agriculture on the Loess Plateau of China. The field study included four main treatments (Huai bean, soybean and mung bean grown as green manure in summer and fallow as control) and four synthetic N rates (0, 108, 135 and 162 kg N ha− 1) applied at wheat sowing. Soybean as LGM increased averaged wheat yield over 4 synthetic N rates by 8% compared with fallow (P < 0.05), and synthetic N requirement was reduced by 33% without compromising the wheat yield for all the main treatments. Although LGM treatments had higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural inputs, the greater amount of C inputs elevated the corresponding SOC stocks (SOCS) by 14–24% after 8 years, thus significantly reducing the CF by 25–51% compared with fallow. The modelled SOCS equilibrium indicates that the CF for cropping systems with LGM will be 53–62% lower than fallow and 23–37% lower compared with their current level. In conclusion, introducing legume green manure instead of summer fallow is a highly efficient measure for persistent CF reduction, and coupling the RothC model and LCA is an alternative method to predict the long-term impact of different cropping systems on GHG emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yao Zhiyuan; Zhang Dabin; Yao Pengwei; Zhao Na; Liu Na; Zhai Bingnian; Zhang Suiqi; Li Yangyang; Huang Donglin; Cao Weidong; Gao Yajun,College of Natural Resources and Environment\Northwest A&F University\China; Bayannaoer Academy of Agricultural and Animal Sciences\Bayannaoer\China; Institute of Soil and Water Conservation\CAS & MWR\China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning\Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences\China,-,Carbon sequestration; GHG profile; Greenhouse gas emissions; Leguminous green manure; Process-oriented model; Wheat yield

The effects of urbanization are exaggerated by climate change and thus the development of innovative stormwater management techniques are necessary to mitigate these impacts. One emerging stormwater management philosophy is low impact development (LID). LID utilizes distributed stormwater controls (often green infrastructure) as well as green spaces and natural hydrologic features in order to bring the hydrology of urban catchments closer to pre-development conditions. The review provides a summary of the knowledge of LID as a stormwater management technique and climate change mitigation measure as well as the current state of research and implementation of this topic. In order to provide a better understanding of the extensive scope that should be considered for design of low impact developments, methods of optimization, modelling, monitoring and the performance of LID alternatives is covered. LID has been widely adopted and proven successful in many cases; however, there remains uncertainty of its benefits. This review brings together knowledge from many sources in order to provide an overview of LID and examine its performance and implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Eckart Kyle; McPhee Zach; Bolisetti Tirupati,Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\University of Windsor\Canada,-,Green infrastructure; LID; LID implementation; LIUDD; Low impact development; Stormwater management; SuDS; Sustainability; WSUD
502.html,"Contamination of organic nutrient sources with potentially toxic elements, antibiotics and pathogen microorganisms in relation to P fertilizer potential and treatment options for the production of sustainable fertilizers: A review","Organic nutrient sources such as farmyard manure, sewage sludge, their biogas digestates or other animal by-products can be valuable fertilizers delivering organic matter to the soil. Currently, especially phosphorus (P) is in the focus of research since it is an essential plant nutrient with finite resources, estimated to last only for some more decades. Efficient utilization of organic P sources in agriculture will help to preserve P resources and thereby has the potential to close nutrient cycles and prevent unwanted P-losses to the environment, one of the major causes for eutrophication of water bodies. Unfortunately, organic P sources usually contain also various detrimental substances, such as potentially toxic elements or organic contaminants like pharmaceuticals as well as pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, the utilization of some of these substrates such as sewage sludge or animal by-products is legally limited in agriculture because of the potential risk to contaminate sites with potentially toxic elements and organic contaminants. Thus, to close nutrient cycles it is important to develop solutions for the responsible use of organic nutrient sources. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the contamination of the most important organic nutrient sources with potentially toxic elements, antibiotics (as one important organic contaminant) and pathogenic microorganisms. Changes in manure and sewage sludge management as well as the increasing trend to use such substrates in biogas plants will be discussed with respect to potential risks posed to soils and water bodies. Some examples for abatement options by which contamination can be reduced to produce P fertilizers with high amounts of plant available P forms are presented. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Julius Kühn-Institut\Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants\Germany; National Veterinary Institute\SVA\Sweden; Outotec GmbH\Ludwig-Erhard-Straße 21\Germany; Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE)\Tietotie 4\Finland,-,Antibiotics; Pathogens; Phosphorus recycling; Thermo chemical treatment; Trace elements
503.html,"Influence of continental organic aerosols to the marine atmosphere over the East China Sea: Insights from lipids, PAHs and phthalates","Total suspended particle (TSP) samples were collected during a marine cruise in the East China Sea from May 18 to June 12, 2014. They were analyzed for solvent extractable organic compounds (lipid compounds, PAHs and phthalates) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to better understand the sources and source apportionment of aerosol pollution in the western North Pacific. Higher concentrations were observed in the terrestrially influenced aerosol samples on the basis of five-day backward air mass trajectories, especially for aerosols collected near coastal areas. Phthalates were found to be the dominant species among these measured compound classes (707 ± 401 ng m− 3for daytime and 313 ± 155 ng m− 3for nighttime), followed by fatty acids, fatty alcohols, n-alkanes and PAHs. In general, the daytime abundances for these compounds are higher than nighttime, possibly attributable to more intensive anthropogenic activities during the daytime. The factor analysis indicates that biomass burning, fungal activities and fossil fuel combustion maybe the main emission sources for organic aerosols over the East China Sea. This study demonstrates that the East Asian continent can be a natural emitter of biogenic and anthropogenic organics to the marine atmosphere through long-range transport, which controls the chemical composition and concentration of organic aerosols over the East China Sea. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Kang Mingjie; Yang Fan; Ren Hong; Zhao Wanyu; Zhao Ye; Li Linjie; Yan Yu; Zhang Yingjie; Lai Senchao; Zhang Yingyi; Yang Yang; Wang Zifa,State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation\School of Environment\China; State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry\Institute of Atmospheric Physics\China; College of Earth Sciences\University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\China; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology\Beijing Normal University\China,-,Marine aerosols; n-Alcohols; n-Alkanes; n-Fatty acids; PAHs; Phthalates
504.html,Interaction patterns and toxicities of binary and ternary pesticide mixtures to Daphnia magna estimated by an accelerated failure time model,"Organisms in natural environments are often exposed to a broad variety of chemicals, and the multi-chemical mixtures exposure may produce significant toxic effects, even though the individual chemicals are present at concentrations below their no-observed-effect concentrations. This study represents the first attempt that uses the accelerated failure time (AFT) model to quantify the interaction and toxicity of multi-chemical mixtures in environmental toxicology. We firstly conducted the acute immobilization tests with Daphnia magna exposed to mixtures of diazinon (DZN), fenitrothion (MEP); and thiobencarb (TB) in single, binary, and ternary formulations, and then fitted the results to the AFT model. The 48-h EC50(concentration required to immobilize 50% of the daphnids at 48 h) values for each pesticide obtained from the AFT model are within a factor of 2 of the corresponding values calculated from the single pesticide exposure tests, indicating the methodology is able to provide credible toxicity values. The AFT model revealed either significant synergistic (DZN and MEP; DZN and TB) or antagonistic (MEP and TB) interactions in binary mixtures, while the interaction pattern of ternary mixture depended on both the concentration levels and concentration ratios of pesticides. With a factor of 2, the AFT model accurately estimated the toxicities for 78% of binary mixture formulations that exhibited significant synergistic effects, and the toxicities for all the ternary formulations. Our results showed that the AFT model can provide a simple and efficient way to quantify the interactions between pesticides and to assess the toxicity of their mixtures. This ability may greatly facilitate the ecotoxicological risk assessment of exposure to multi-chemical mixtures. © 2017",Qiu Xuchun; Tanoue Wataru; Kawaguchi Atsushi; Yanagawa Takashi; Seki Masanori; Shimasaki Yohei; Honjo Tsuneo; Oshima Yuji,Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology\Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Sciences\Japan; Clinical Research Center\School of Medicine\Japan; Biostatistics Center\Kurume University\Japan; Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute\3-2-7\Japan,-,Accelerated failure time model; Acute immobilization tests; Antagonism; Daphnia magna; Interactive mixtures; Synergism
505.html,Fate and impacts of pharmaceuticals and personal care products after repeated applications of organic waste products in long-term field experiments,"Recycling organic waste products in agriculture is a potential route for the dispersion of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. In this study, the concentrations of thirteen pharmaceuticals and the personal care product triclosan (PPCPs) were determined in different environmental matrices from long-term experimental fields amended with different organic waste products (OWPs), including sludge, composted sludge with green wastes, livestock effluents and composted urban wastes applied at usual agricultural rates. PPCP concentrations were different in OWPs, varying from a few micrograms to milligrams per kilogram dry matter or per litre for slurry. OWPs from sludge or livestock effluents primarily contained antibiotics, whereas composted urban wastes primarily contained anti-inflammatory compounds. PPCP contents in soils amended for several years were less than a few micrograms per kilogram. The most persistent compounds (fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine) were quantified or detected in soils amended with sludge or composted sludge. In soils amended with composted municipal solid waste, carbamazepine was quantified, and fluoroquinolones, ibuprofen and diclofenac were sometimes detected. The small increases in fluoroquinolones and carbamazepine in soils after individual OWP applications were consistent with the fluxes from the applied OWP. The measured concentrations of pharmaceuticals in soil after several successive OWP applications were lower than the predicted concentrations because of degradation, strong sorption to soil constituents and/or leaching. Dissipation half-lives (DT50) were approximately 750–2500, 900 and < 300 days for fluoroquinolones, carbamazepine and ibuprofen, respectively, in temperate soils and < 350 and < 80 days for fluoroquinolones and doxycycline, respectively, in tropical soils. Detection frequencies in soil leachates were very low (below 7%), and concentrations ranged from the limits of detection (0.002–0.03 μg/L) and exceptionally to 0.27 μg/L. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were carbamazepine and ibuprofen. Based on the risk quotient, the estimated ecotoxicological risks for different soil organisms were low. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bourdat-Deschamps Marjolaine; Ferhi Sabrina; Bernet Nathalie; Feder Fréderic; Crouzet Olivier; Patureau Dominique; Montenach Denis; Moussard Géraud D.; Mercier Vincent; Benoit Pierre; Houot Sabine,UMR ECOSYS\INRA\France; UMR ECOSYS\INRA\France; CIRAD\UPR Recyclage et risque\France; LBE\INRA\France,-,Antibiotics; Ecotoxicological risk assessment; Environmental matrices; Livestock effluents; Sewage sludge; Urban composts

507.html,Photochemical behavior of dissolved and colloidal organic matter in estuarine and oceanic waters,"Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), carbohydrates, and amino acids were analyzed to investigate the photochemistry of total dissolved (< 0.22 μm) organic matter (DOM), high-molecular-weight (HMW, 1 kDa–0.22 μm) DOM and low-molecular-weight (LMW, < 1 kDa) DOM at stations in the Yangtze River and its coastal area, and in the Western Pacific Ocean. Results revealed that the humic-like and tryptophan-like CDOM fluorescent components in riverine, coastal, and oceanic surface waters were photodegraded during irradiation. However, the photochemical behavior of tyrosine-like component was obscured by the excessive fluorescence intensities of humic- and tryptophan-like fluorescent components. Light sensitivity varied depending on the source material; terrestrially derived DOM was more susceptible to irradiation than autochthonous DOM. In contrast to the expected photodegradation of CDOM, photo-induced synthetic reaction transformed the LMW matters to polysaccharides (PCHO) and degradation reaction decomposed the HMW DOM to Monosaccharides. Colloidal DOM preferentially underwent photodegradation, whereas permeate DOM mainly photosynthesized PCHO. The total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA) pool changed because of the additional input by the photodegradation of DOM or THAA itself. The compositions of THAA changed during the irradiation experiments, indicating that the different photochemical behavior of individual amino acids were related to their different original photoreactivities; the relatively stable amino acids (e.g., Ser and Gly) significantly accumulated during irradiation, whereas photo-active aromatic amino acids (e.g. Tyr and His) were prone to photodegradation. The data presented here demonstrated that irradiation significantly influence the conversion between dissolved and colloid organic matter. These results can promote the understanding of irradiation effect on the carbon and nitrogen cycle in riverine, estuarine and oceanic ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhu Wen-Zhuo; Yang Gui-Peng; Zhang Hong-Hai,Key Laboratory of Marine Chemistry Theory and Technology\Ocean University of China\China; Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science\Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology\China; Institute of Marine Chemistry\Ocean University of China\China,-,Amino acids; Carbohydrates; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM); Colloidal organic matter; Photochemistry
508.html,The role of microbial diversity and composition in minimizing sludge production in the oxic-settling-anoxic process,"The oxic-settling-anoxic (OSA) process, which involves an aerobic tank attached to oxygen- and substrate-deficient external anoxic reactors, minimizes sludge production in biological wastewater treatment. In this study, the microbial community structure of OSA was determined. Principal coordinate analysis showed that among the three operational factors, i.e., (i) redox condition, (ii) external reactor sludge retention time (SRText), and (iii) sludge interchange between aerobic and anoxic reactors, redox condition had the greatest impact on microbial diversity. Generally, reactors with lower oxidation-reduction potential had higher microbial diversity. The main aerobic sequencing batch reactor of OSA (SBROSA) that interchanged sludge with an external anoxic reactor had greater microbial diversity than SBRcontrolwhich did not have sludge interchange. SBROSAsustained high abundance of the slow-growing nitrifying bacteria (e.g., Nitrospirales and Nitrosomondales) and consequently exhibited reduced sludge yield. Specific groups of bacteria facilitated sludge autolysis in the external reactors. Hydrolyzing (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi) and fermentative (e.g., Firmicutes) bacteria, which can break down cellular matter, proliferated in both the external aerobic/anoxic and anoxic reactors. Sludge autolysis in the anoxic reactor was enhanced with the increase of predatory bacteria (e.g., order Myxobacteriales and genus Bdellovibrio) that can contribute to biomass decay. Furthermore, β- and γ-Proteobacteria were identified as the bacterial phyla that primarily underwent decay in the external reactors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Semblante Galilee U.; Phan Hop V.; Hai Faisal I.; Xu Zhi-Qiang; Price William E.; Nghiem Long D.,Strategic Water Infrastructure Laboratory\School of Civil\Australia; Centre for Medical and Molecular Bioscience\University of Wollongong\Australia; Strategic Water Infrastructure Laboratory\School of Chemistry\Australia,-,Fermentative bacteria; Hydrolyzing bacteria; Illumina sequencing; Microbial community analysis; Oxidation-reduction potential; Predatory bacteria
509.html,"Urban growth and water access in sub-Saharan Africa: Progress, challenges, and emerging research directions","For the next decade, the global water crisis remains the risk of highest concern, and ranks ahead of climate change, extreme weather events, food crises and social instability. Across the globe, nearly one in ten people is without access to an improved drinking water source. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are the most affected, having disproportionately more of the global population without access to clean water than other major regions. Population growth, changing lifestyles, increasing pollution and accelerating urbanization will continue to widen the gap between the demand for water and available supply especially in urban areas, and disproportionately affect informal settlements, where the majority of SSA's urban population resides. Distribution and allocation of water will be affected by climate-induced water stresses, poor institutions, ineffective governance, and weak political will to address scarcity and mediate uncertainties in future supply. While attempts have been made by many scientists to examine different dimensions of water scarcity and urban population dynamics, there are few comprehensive reviews, especially focused on the particular situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper contributes to interdisciplinary understanding of urban water supply by distilling and integrating relevant empirical knowledge on urban dynamics and water issues in SSA, focusing on progress made and associated challenges. It then points out future research directions including the need to understand how alternatives to centralized water policies may help deliver sustainable water supply to cities and informal settlements in the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Institut de Recherche pour le Développement\Laboratoire Population-Environnement-Développement (IRD/AMU)\France; Global Studies Institute\Department of Geosciences\United States; Department of Geography\Royal Holloway\United Kingdom; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\Laxenburg\Austria,-,Governance; Population; Sub-Saharan Africa; Urban dynamics; Water access; Water scarcity

This work aimed to study the effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and their mixture on PFOS accumulation, antioxidant defenses and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish. The fish was dissected after being exposed (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) separately to PFOS, SWCNT and PFOS + SWCNT co-exposure. The bioaccumulation of PFOS in fish tissues (liver, intestines, gills and brain) decreased with increasing dosage of SWCNT, however, the opposite trend was observed in fish skin, which indicated that the bioavailability of PFOS changed by adsorption on SWCNT. Meanwhile, co-exposure induced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than PFOS alone and enhanced the effect of PFOS on the superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) and AChE activities. Furthermore, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) showed that co-exposure was the most stressful circumstance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Yaxuan; Men Bin; He Yi; Xu Haiming; Liu Meiqi; Wang Dongsheng,State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Science\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; The Department of Occupational and Environment Health\School of Public Health and Management\China,-,AChE; Bioconcentration; Co-exposure; Oxidative stress; PFOS; SWCNT

Here, soil nematode communities were used as an indicator of soil health and soil food web structure to evaluate the potential effects of growing Bt rice without chemical insecticides for 3 years in the paddy field. The nematodes and soil physicochemical properties of Bt rice fields were compared to the near-isogenic control, non-Bt rice fields. A total of 108,363 specimens belonging to 28 different genera were enumerated. The Hirschmanniella, Tobrilus, Dorylaimus and Filenchus were dominant genera. A three-year paddy rice cultivation of Bt rice (Huahui 1) negatively affected the abundance of phytoparasitic nematodes but did not affect the total number of nematodes, the abundance and relative abundance of free-living nematodes, genera richness, diversity indices, soil food web conditions, or community compositions. However, apparent seasonal and inter-annual changes in these variables were observed, indicating that the impact of environmental factors was more stronger than that of the Bt toxin. In conclusion, the potential ecological risks of Bt rice on soil health and sustainability warrant further research to disentangle the impacts from various confounding environmental factors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Chen Qunying; Yang Bing; Liu Xianghui; Chen Fajun; Ge Feng,State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents\Institute of Zoology\China; Key Laboratory of Mountain Ecological Restoration and Bioresource Utilization & Ecological Restoration\Biodiversity Conservation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province\China; College of Plant Protection\Nanjing Agricultural University\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China,-,Community composition; Functional diversity; Generalized estimating equations model (GEE); Soil food webs; Transgenic Bt rice

Thus, metabolites or degradation products, such as CHHQ (dihydroxychloroquinoxalin), CHQ (6-chloroquinoxalin-2-ol), PPA ((R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid) and 2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline were also monitored. An extraction procedure based on QuEChERS procedure was used. Acidified water (0.1 M hydrochloric acid) and acidified acetonitrile (1% acetic acid, (v/v)) were used as extraction solvents, and magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride were used as salts. Dispersive solid phase extraction with C18as sorbent, was needed as a clean-up step. Several commercial products (Panarex®, Master-D® and Dixon®) were used to evaluate the degradation of the target compounds into their metabolites. The concentration of the main active substances (quizalofop-p-tefuryl, quizalofop-p-ethyl and propaquizafop) decreased during the degradation studies, whereas the concentration of quizalofop-p increased. Dissipation rates of half-live of quizalofop-p were also evaluated, and it was observed that this compound is easily degraded, obtaining values lower than 1 day. Taking into account that quizalofop-p is the R enantiomer of quizalofop, a chiral separation was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, concluding that in samples containing quizalofop-p-tefuryl, there was a 15% contribution from the S enantiomer and a 85% contribution from the R enantiomer. Metabolites such as PPA, CHHQ and CHQ were detected in soil samples after 15 days of application commercial product at concentrations between the limits of detection (LOD) and the limits of quantification (LOQ). CHQ and CHHQ were detected at concentrations higher than the LOQ in samples after 50 and 80 days of application, with their concentration increasing during this time up to 500%. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",López-Ruiz Rosalía; Romero-González Roberto; Martínez Vidal José Luis; Fernández-Pérez Manuel; Garrido Frenich Antonia,Department of Chemistry and Physics\Research Centre for Agricultural and Food Biotechnology (BITAL)\Spain,-,Degradation study; Enantiomeric separation; Metabolites; Propaquizafop; Quizalofop-p; UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS

Based on the disparities between the brightness temperatures of lake ice and water, passive microwave data can be used to monitor the ice variations of a lake. With focus on the analysis of long time series variability of lake ice, this study extracts four characteristic dates related to lake ice (the annual freeze start, freeze completion, ablation start and ablation completion dates) for Qinghai Lake from 1979 to 2016 using Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave brightness temperature data. The corresponding freezing duration, ablation duration, complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration are calculated. Applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow products, the accuracy of the results derived from passive microwave data is validated. The validation analysis shows a strong agreement (R2ranges from 0.70 to 0.85, mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 2.25 to 3.94 days) in the freeze start, ablation start, and ablation completion dates derived from the MODIS data and passive microwave data; the ice coverage duration also has a small error (relative error (RE) = 2.95%, MAE = 3.13 days), suggesting that the results obtained from passive microwave data are reliable. The results show that the freezing dates of Qinghai Lake have been delayed and the ablation dates have advanced. Over 38 years, the freeze start date and freeze completion date have been pushed back by 6.16 days and 2.27 days, respectively, while the ablation start date and ablation completion date have advanced by 11.24 days and 14.09 days, respectively. The freezing duration and ablation duration have shortened by 3.89 days and 2.85 days, respectively, and the complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration have shortened by 14.84 days and 21.21 days, respectively. There is a significant negative correlation between the ice coverage duration and the mean air temperature in winter. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Cai Yu; Ke Chang-Qing; Duan Zheng,Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science and Technology\Nanjing University\China; School of Geographic and Oceanographic Sciences\Nanjing University\China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization\Nanjing\China; Technical University of Munich\Munich\Germany,-,Climate warming; Freeze-thaw dates; Lake ice; MODIS; Passive microwave remote sensing; Qinghai Lake
514.html,Effects of apple branch biochar on soil C mineralization and nutrient cycling under two levels of N,"The incorporation of biochar into soil has been proposed as a strategy for enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity. However, there is limited information regarding the responses of soil respiration and the C, N and P cycles to the addition of apple branch biochar at different rates to soil with different levels of N. A 108-day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the rate of biochar addition (0, 1, 2 and 4% by mass) on soil respiration and nutrients and the activities of enzymes involved in C, N and P cycling under two levels of N. Our results showed that the application of apple branch biochar at rates of 2% and 4% increased the C-mineralization rate, while biochar amendment at 1% decreased the C-mineralization rate, regardless of the N level. The soil organic C and microbial biomass C and P contents increased as the rate of biochar addition was increased to 2%. The biochar had negative effects on β-glucosidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase and urease activity in N-poor soil but exerted a positive effect on all of these factors in N-rich soil. Alkaline phosphatase activity increased with an increase in the rate of biochar addition, but the available P contents after all biochar addition treatments were lower than those obtained in the treatments without biochar. Biochar application at rates of 2% and 4% reduced the soil nitrate content, particularly in N-rich soil. Thus, apple branch biochar has the potential to sequester C and improve soil fertility, but the responses of soil C mineralization and nutrient cycling depend on the rate of addition and soil N levels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Li Shuailin; Liang Chutao; Shangguan Zhouping,State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau\Institute of Soil and Water Conservation\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China,-,Biochar; Enzyme activity; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil carbon
515.html,Soil aggregate stability and size-selective sediment transport with surface runoff as affected by organic residue amendment,"Aggregate breakdown influences the availability of soil particles for size-selective sediment transport with surface runoff during erosive rainfall events. Organic matter management is known to affect aggregate stability against breakdown, but little is known about how this translates into rainfall-induced aggregate fragmentation and sediment transport under field conditions. In this study, we performed field experiments in which artificial rainfall was applied after pre-wetting on three pairs of arable soil plots (1.5 × 0.75 m) six weeks after incorporating a mixture of grass and wheat straw into the topsoil of one plot in each pair (OI treatment) but not on the other plot (NI treatment). Artificial rainfall was applied for approximately 2 h on each pair at an intensity of 49.1 mm h− 1. In both treatments, discharge and sediment concentration in the discharge were correlated and followed a similar temporal pattern after the onset of surface runoff: After a sharp increase at the beginning both approached a steady state. But the onset of runoff was more delayed on the OI plots, and the discharge and sediment concentration were in average only roughly half as high on the OI as on the NI plots. With increasing discharge the fraction of coarse sediment increased. This relationship did not differ between the two treatments. Thus, due to the lower discharge, the fraction of fine particles in the exported sediment was larger in the runoff from the OI plots than from the NI plots. The later runoff onset and lower discharge rate was related to a higher initial aggregate stability on the OI plots. Terrestrial laser scanning proved to be a very valuable method to map changes in the micro-topography of the soil surfaces. It revealed a much less profound decrease in surface roughness on the OI than on the NI plots. © 2016",Shi Pu; Arter Christian; Liu Xingyu; Keller Martin; Schulin Rainer,Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems\ETH Zürich\Switzerland; Institute of Environmental Engineering\ETH Zürich\Switzerland,-,Aggregate breakdown; Artificial rainfall; Soil erosion; Surface roughness; Terrestrial laser scanning
516.html,Temperature sensitivity of total soil respiration and its heterotrophic and autotrophic components in six vegetation types of subtropical China,"The temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) is a key parameter for estimating the feedback of soil respiration to global warming. The Q10of total soil respiration (Rt) has been reported to have high variability at both local and global scales, and vegetation type is one of the most important drivers. However, little is known about how vegetation types affect the Q10of soil heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) respirations, despite their contrasting roles in soil carbon sequestration and ecosystem carbon cycles. In the present study, five typical plantation forests and a naturally developed shrub and herb land in subtropical China were selected for investigation of soil respiration. Trenching was conducted to separate Rhand Rain each vegetation type. The results showed that both Rtand Rhwere significantly correlated with soil temperature in all vegetation types, whereas Rawas significantly correlated with soil temperature in only four vegetation types. Moreover, on average, soil temperature explained only 15.0% of the variation in Rain the six vegetation types. These results indicate that soil temperature may be not a primary factor affecting Ra. Therefore, modeling of Rabased on its temperature sensitivity may not always be valid. The Q10of Rhwas significantly affected by vegetation types, which indicates that the response of the soil carbon pool to climate warming may vary with vegetation type. In contrast, differences in neither the Q10of Rtnor that of Raamong these vegetation types were significant. Additionally, variation in the Q10of Rtamong vegetation types was negatively related to fine root biomass, whereas the Q10of Rhwas mostly related to total soil nitrogen. However, the Q10of Rawas not correlated with any of the environmental variables monitored in this study. These results emphasize the importance of independently studying the temperature sensitivity of Rtand its heterotrophic and autotrophic components. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yu Shiqin; Chen Yuanqi; Zhao Jie; Fu Shenglei; Li Zhian; Xia Hanping; Zhou Lixia,Key Laboratory of Vegetation Restoration and Management of Degraded Ecosystems\South China Botanical Garden\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Coal Resources Clean-utilization and Mine Environment Protection\Hunan University of Science and Technology\China; Key Laboratory of Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region\Institute of Subtropical Agriculture\China,-,Autotrophic respiration; Heterotrophic respiration; Q10; Soil carbon; Soil CO2efflux; Vegetation
517.html,Young calcareous soil chronosequences as a model for ecological restoration on alkaline mine tailings,"Tailings are artificial soil-forming substrates that have not been created by the natural processes of soil formation and weathering. The extreme pH environment and corresponding low availability of some macro- and micronutrients in alkaline tailings, coupled with hostile physical and geochemical conditions, present a challenging environment to native biota. Some significant nutritional constraints to ecosystem reconstruction on alkaline tailings include i) predominant or complete absence of combined nitrogen (N) and poor soil N retention; ii) the limited bioavailability of some micronutrients at high soil pH (e.g., Mn, Fe, Zn and Cu); and iii) potentially toxic levels of biologically available soil phosphorus (P) for P-sensitive plants. The short regulatory time frames (years) for mine closure on tailings landforms are at odds with the long time required for natural pedogenic processes to ameliorate these factors (thousands of years). However, there are similarities between the chemical composition and nutrient status of alkaline tailings and the poorly-developed, very young calcareous soils of biodiverse regions such as south-western Australia. We propose that basic knowledge of chronosequences that start with calcareous soils may provide an informative model for understanding the pedogenic processes required to accelerate soil formation on tailings. Development of a functional, stable root zone is crucial to successful ecological restoration on tailings, and three major processes should be facilitated as early as possible during processing or in the early stages of restoration to accelerate soil development on alkaline tailings: i) acidification of the upper tailings profile; ii) establishment of appropriate and resilient microbial communities; and iii) the early development of appropriate pioneer vegetation. Achieving successful ecological restoration outcomes on tailings landforms is likely one of the greatest challenges faced by restoration ecologists and the mining industry, and successful restoration on alkaline tailings likely depends upon careful management of substrate chemical conditions by targeted amendments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cross Adam T.; Lambers Hans,Centre for Mine Site Restoration\Department of Environment and Agriculture\Australia; School of Biological Sciences\The University of Western Australia\Australia; Kings Park and Botanic Garden\Kings Park\Australia,-,Mine tailings; Pedogenesis; Plant mineral nutrition; Soil acidification; Soil weathering
518.html,Natural degradation of roxarsone in contrasting soils: Degradation kinetics and transformation products,"Roxarsone (ROX) is transformed to more toxic arsenicals after land application of ROX-containing poultry litter to agricultural soils. To date, no reports have compared ROX degradation in soils with contrasting properties. In this study, the impact of different incubation conditions on ROX degradation was investigated in red (C-Soil) and yellow-brown (H-Soil) soils. The degradation half-lives of extractable ROX in C-Soil and H-Soil were found to be 130–394 d and 4–94 d, respectively, indicating that the extractable ROX degraded faster in H-Soil. This result stems from the higher organic matter content, more abundant soil microbes, and lower ROX sorption capacity of H-Soil compared to C-Soil. Degradation of extractable ROX in both C-Soil and H-Soil was significantly promoted by soil moisture and exogenous glucose. Exogenous P(V) facilitated degradation of extractable ROX in C-Soil, but limited effects were observed for H-Soil. HPLC-ICP-MS analysis confirmed that ROX and dimethylarsinic acid were the predominant As species in soil extracts from 119-day incubated C-Soil and H-Soil, respectively. Ultimately, minimal transformation of extractable ROX was observed in C-Soil, but the majority of extractable ROX in H-Soil was biologically transformed. The differences in degradation of extractable ROX in C-Soil and H-Soil highlight the key roles of soil properties on the environmental fate of ROX and associated arsenicals.

519.html,Different sizes of ZnO diversely affected the cytogenesis of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus,"Today nanoparticles (NPs) have many applications in commercial products due to their small size and peculiar properties that, conversely, make them potentially toxic for humans and the environment. ZnO NPs are largely used in many personal care products, such as sunscreens and cosmetics. In this study the cytotoxic effects of ZnO particles with different sizes (ZnO Bulk, > 100 nm; ZnO NPs, 100 nm and ZnO NPs, 14 nm) upon the first developmental stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, are evaluated. Morphological alterations are also assessed by embryotoxicity tests. The cytogenetic analysis highlighted that ZnO NPs interfere with cell cycle inducing a dose-dependent decrease of mitotic activity and chromosomal aberrations at higher concentrations (30 μM). Moreover, the larval development was affected by ZnO NPs 100 nm (EC50 = 0.46 [0.30–0.63] μM [Zn]) in a dose-dependent way. Size-dependent toxicity was instead not obtained for ZnO NPs. From our results could be highlighted that the presence of embryos, blocked in pre-larval stage, could be due to the induction of chromosome aberrations by ZnO particles, confirming that cytogenetic analyses allow evaluating possible NPs action mechanisms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Oliviero Maria; Schiavo Simona; Rametta Gabriella; Miglietta Maria Lucia; Manzo Sonia,Department of Science and Technology\Parthenope University of Naples\Italy; Enea CR Portici\P.le E.

520.html,Coral trace metal of natural and anthropogenic influences in the northern South China Sea,"The composition and concentrations of trace metals in coastal seawater have changed in parallel with variations in geochemical processes, climate and anthropogenic activities. To evaluate the response of trace metals in coastal seawater to climatic changes and human disturbances, we report annual-resolution trace element data for a Porites coral core covering ~ 100 years of continuous growth from a fringing reef in Xiaodonghai Bay in the northern South China Sea. The results suggested that the trace metal contents in the coral skeleton demonstrated decadal to interdecadal fluctuations with several large or small peaks in certain years with remarkable environmental significances. All of the trace metals in coastal surface seawater, especially Cr and Pb (related to industrial or traffic emissions), were impacted by terrestrial inputs, except for Sr and U, which were impacted by the surface seawater temperature (SST). Moreover, Mn, Ni, Fe and Co were also contributed by weapons and military supplies during wars, and Cu, Cd and Zn were further impacted by upwelling associated with their biogeochemical cycles. Ba and rare earth element (REE) in coastal surface seawater were dominated by runoff and groundwater discharge associated with precipitation. This study provided the potential for some trace metals (e.g., REE, Ba, Cu, Cd, and Zn) in coral skeletons to be used as proxies of natural (e.g., upwelling and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., war and coastal construction) variability of seawater chemistry to enable the reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes through time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Jiang Wei; Yu Ke-Fu; Song Yin-Xian; Zhao Jian-Xin; Feng Yue-Xing; Wang Ying-Hui; Xu Shen-Dong,Guangxi Laboratory on the Study of Coral Reefs in the South China Sea\Coral Reef Research Centre of China\China; College of Environment and Engineering\Hohai University\China; School of Earth Sciences\The University of Queensland\Australia,-,Anthropogenic activity; Coral; Rare earth element; Source; Trace metal
521.html,"Organophosphate esters in sediment cores from coastal Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea, China","Concentrations and vertical distributions of organophosphate esters (OPEs) were investigated in the sediment cores collected from the Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea of China. The total concentrations of OPEs in the sediment core (CA) collected near the Yellow River Estuary were in the range of 11.8–102 ng/g, while the total concentrations in the sediment core (CB) near a mariculture area were 6.65–41.5 ng/g. Significantly high concentrations of OPEs were found in the sediments near the Yellow River Estuary than those in the mariculture area. Vertical distributions in the sediment cores demonstrated a recent increase of OPE emissions, especially for tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP). Generally, TCEP and TCPP were the dominant congeners in the sediment cores, while the profiles of TnBP were increase in the surface 0–20 cm layers of the CA core. OPEs in the CA core may be remarkably influenced by the discharge of Yellow River, whereas OPEs in the CB core may originate from the transport through seawater. The remarkable increase of OPE flame retardants in the surface sediments raises the concern about their emissions and risks to the environment and indicates the need for further monitoring. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Yan; Wu Xiaowei; Zhang Qiaonan; Hou Minmin; Zhao Hongxia; Xie Qing; Du Juan; Chen Jingwen,Key Laboratory of Industrial Ecology and Environmental Engineering (MOE)\School of Environmental Science and Technology\China,-,Bohai Sea; Organophosphate esters; Organophosphorus flame retardants; Sediment core
522.html,Pyrolysis of attapulgite clay blended with yak dung enhances pasture growth and soil health: Characterization and initial field trials,"Recent studies have shown that the pyrolysis of biomass combined with clay can result in both lower cost and increase in plant yields. One of the major sources of nutrients for pasture growth, as well as fuel and building materials in Tibet is yak dung. This paper reports on the initial field testing in a pasture setting in Tibet using yak dung, biochar, and attapulgite clay/yak dung biochars produced at ratios of 10/90 and 50/50 clay to dung. We found that the treatment with attapulgite clay/yak dung (50/50) biochar resulted in the highest pasture yields and grass nutrition quality. We also measured the properties and yields of mixtures of clay/yak dung biochar used in the field trials produced at 400 °C and 500 °C to help determine a possible optimum final pyrolysis temperature and dung/clay ratio. It was observed that increasing clay content increased carbon stability, overall biochar yield, pore size, carboxyl and ketone/aldehyde functional groups, hematite and ferrous/ferric sulphate/thiosulphate concentration, surface area and magnetic moment. Decreasing clay content resulted in higher pH, CEC, N content and an enhanced ability to accept and donate electrons. The resulting properties were a complex function of both processing temperature and the percentage of clay for the biochars processed at both 400 °C and 500 °C. It is possible that the increase in yield and nutrient uptake in the field trial is related to the higher concentration of C/O functional groups, higher surface area and pore volume and higher content of Fe/O/S nanoparticles of multiple oxidation state in the 50/50 clay/dung. These properties have been found to significantly increase the abundance of beneficial microorganisms and hence improve the nutrient cycling and availability in soil. Further field trials are required to determine the optimum pyrolysis production conditions and application rate on the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, yields and nutrient quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Rafiq Muhammad Khalid; Joseph Stephen D.; Li Fei; Bai Yanfu; Shang Zhanhuan; Rawal Aditya; Hook James M.; Munroe Paul R.; Donne Scott; Taherymoosavi Sara; Mitchell David R.G.; Pace Ben,College of Pastoral Agriculture\Science and Technology Agric\China; Directorate of Range Mgt and Forestry\Pakistan Agricultural Research Council Islamabad\Pakistan; University of Newcastle\School of Environmental and Life Sciences\Australia; School of Materials Science and Engineering\University of New South Wales\Australia,-,Attapulgite clay; Enhanced biochar; Pasture growth; Soil health; Yak dung
523.html,Long-term net transformation and quantitative molecular mechanisms of soil nitrogen during natural vegetation recovery of abandoned farmland on the Loess Plateau of China,"The availability of nitrogen (N) can alter vegetation species composition and diversity in degraded ecosystems. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic fate of ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3−-N) processing and the underlying mechanisms are still lacking, particularly in arid to semi-arid degraded ecosystems. We compared and quantified the changes in the rates of net ammonification (Ra), nitrification (Rn) and total mineralization (Rm) and the abundance of bacteria, archaea, and microbial genes related to N transformation on the northern Loess Plateau of China across a 40-year chronosequence of farmland undergoing spontaneous restoration. We found that Ra, Rn, and Rmdecreased in grassland soils (0–30-y sites) of different ages and exhibited significant increases at the 40-y sites. The capabilities of the soil to deliver NH4+-N and NO3−-N were not a limiting factor during the growing season after 40 years of vegetation recovery. Soil mineral nitrogen may be not suitable for predicting and assessing the long-term (approximately 40 years) restoration success and progress. The abundance of functional N genes showed differences in sensitivity to natural vegetation recovery of abandoned farmland, which likely reflects the fact that the multi-pathways driven by N functional microbial communities had a large influence on the dynamic fate of NH4+-N and NO3−-N. Quantitative response relationships between net N transformation rates and microbial genes related to N transformation were established, and these relationships confirmed that different N transformation processes were strongly linked with certain N functional genes, and collaboratively contributed to N transformation as vegetation recovery progressed.

524.html,"Temporal and spatial variation of N2O production from estuarine and marine shallow systems of Cadiz Bay (SW, Spain)","There is still much uncertainty regarding the global oceanic emissions of N2O, and particularly emissions from coastal regions, because spatio-temporal datasets have limited coverage. The concentration of dissolved N2O in surface waters and the associated fluxes to the atmosphere have been studied in three coastal systems located near Cadiz Bay (southwestern coast of Spain) over different time scales. The three systems present different hydrodynamic characteristics (an estuary and two marine systems) that influence the distribution of N2O in the water column. Nutrients, oxygen, and particulate organic nitrogen were also measured to investigate the processes responsible for N2O production in the water column. Data on dissolved N2O has been obtained in each system from i) two-year monitoring at fixed station; ii) four seasonal samplings along the longitudinal length of the system; and iii) daily sampling in summer. The concentration of N2O ranges between 1.1 and 292.0 nM indicating very high spatio-temporal variability. In general, the concentration of N2O increased during the rainy season associated with the precipitation regime that, in turn, increases the lateral inputs of organic matter and nutrients from both natural sources (discharges into rivers and adjacent marshes) and anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urban effluents and fish farming). Dissolved N2O also varied with the tides: the highest concentrations were measured during the ebb, which suggests that the systems export N2O to the Bay and adjacent Atlantic Ocean. In addition nitrification seems to be an important process for N2O formation in the water column, which also explains some of the variability in the dataset. The mean atmospheric flux of N2O reveals that entire study area was a net source of N2O to the atmosphere. The fluxes ranged between 0.5 and 313.2 μmol m− 2day−1in the estuarine system, and between − 7.2 and 97.8 μmol m− 2day−1in the two marine systems. © 2017",Burgos Macarena; Ortega Teodora; Forja Jesús M.,Dpto.

525.html,Assessing the use of δ18O in phosphate as a tracer for catchment phosphorus sources,"Procedures for source apportionment of nutrients transported in rivers and streams are often uncertain and difficult to validate. In this study, we investigated if the oxygen isotope ratios in stream dissolved phosphate (δ18OP) can be used to distinguish between the phosphorus (P) originating from agricultural runoff and from rural sewage, at different periods of the year. Water was collected from septic tanks, drainage wells and the stream outlet in a small (7.3 km2) agricultural catchment to capture variations in the isotope signature at different flow events. The δ18OPsignature in septic tank effluent (+ 13.2 to + 14.5‰) was significantly different from that in drainage water (+ 9.0 to + 15.7‰). Four different septic tanks had surprisingly similar isotope signature when 24 h composite samples were collected. Most of the water samples were not in oxygen isotope equilibrium. In three drainage wells, the δ18OPsignature varied from + 7.8 up to + 15.7‰ with higher values in periods with a larger contribution of superficial streamflow generation. A rainfall soon after manure had been spread resulted in a δ18OPof 15.7‰ in a drainage well, and was also reflected in a similar value at the catchment outlet. This implies that the source isotope signal may be conserved during moderate or high flows. A three end-member model including the geological background would be a useful start to quantify the P contribution from diverse sources. Temporal differences in biological activity and the predominant transport pathways through soil profiles must be considered along with information about fertilisation. In combination with hydrological modelling of water pathways, this may considerably improve our understanding of catchment P losses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Tonderski Karin; Andersson Lotta; Lindström Göran; St Cyr Rasmus; Schönberg Ronny; Taubald Heinrich,Linköping University\IFM Biology\Sweden; Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)\Norrköping\Sweden; University of Tübingen\Isotopegeochemistry\Germany,-,Drainage pipes; Hydrological pathways; Oxygen isotopes; Sewage; Source apportionment
526.html,Increased tolerance to oil exposure by the cosmopolitan marine copepod Acartia tonsa,"Oil contamination is an environmental hazard to marine ecosystems, but marine organism tolerance to oil after many generations of exposure remains poorly known. We studied the effects of transgenerational oil exposure on fitness-related traits in a cosmopolitan neritic copepod, Acartia tonsa. Copepods were exposed to an oil compound, the PAH pyrene, at concentrations of 1, 10, 100 and 100+ (the saturated pyrene concentration in seawater) nM over two generations and measured survival, sex ratio, size at maturity, grazing rate and reproductive success. Exposure to the pyrene concentration of 100+ nM resulted in 100% mortality before adulthood in the first generation. At the pyrene concentration of 100 nM, pyrene reduced grazing rate, increased mortality, reduced the size of females and caused lower egg production and hatching success. Importantly, we found strong evidence for increased tolerance to pyrene exposure in the second generation: the reduction in size at maturity of females was less pronounced in the second generation and survival, egg production and hatching success were recovered to control levels in the second generation. The increased tolerance of copepods to oil contamination may dampen the direct ecological consequences of a coastal oil spill, but it raises the concern whether a larger fraction of oil components accumulated in survived copepods, may be transferred up the food web. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Krause Kamille Elvstrøm; Dinh Khuong V.; Nielsen Torkel Gissel,Section for Oceans and Arctic\National Institute of Aquatic Resources\Denmark,-,Coastal ecosystem; Egg production; Marine zooplankton; Oil spill; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Transgenerational study

The microcosm treatments represented low (270 ppm), present (380 ppm), and high (750 ppm) pCO2conditions. Elevated CO2decreased pH and increased aqueous CO2concentrations, and did not change alkalinity. The maximum reduction of pH was 0.26 when CO2increased from current level to 750 ppm at the ending of experiment in the spring. The rise of pCO2stimulated the growth of phytoplankton, and the net primary production could increase by 35% when CO2was elevated from current level to 750 ppm in summer. Interestingly, our results indicated that increasing pCO2affected phytoplankton community structure in the microcosms. Cyanobacteria tended to be superior under high pCO2, with two species Anabaena circinalis and Anabaena eucompacta benefitting from the rising pCO2. The response of chlorophytes and diatoms to the rise of pCO2depended on taxa. In contrast, increased CO2did not change biomass or productivity of phytoplankton in spring, when biomass was relatively low. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Shi Xiaoli; Li Shengnan; Wei Lijun; Qin Boqiang; Brookes Justin D.,State Key Laboratory of Lake Science and Environment\Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology\China; Water Research Centre\Environment Institute\Australia,-,CO2elevation; Freshwater Lake; Phytoplankton; Taihu

In this study, CW-MFC has been associated with three macrophytes (J. effuses, T. orientalis and S. validus) for domestic sewage treatment, also unplanted CW-MFC was performed as a control system. Macrophyte T. orientalis and S. validus can significantly strengthen the bioenergy output in CW-MFC. Highest current (94.27 mA m− 2) and power densities (21.53 mW m− 2) were obtained in CW-MFC planted with T. orientalis. Removal efficiencies of COD, NO3-N and NH3-N in CW-MFC planted with S. validus was respectively 5.8%, 7.2%, and 23.9% higher than that of unplanted system. Notably, the oxygen depletion in S. validus CW-MFC reactor during the dark cycle was higher that of other reactors. Results of high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that higher biodiversity was observed in rhizosphere than that of anode material, and the relative abundance of Desulfobulbus sp. and Geobacter sp. has been apparently promoted in the samples of rhizosphere. However, a higher relative abundance of electrochemically active bacteria (Proteobacteria) was observed on the surface of anode electrode material. In addition, microbes (Cytophagales, Clostridium sp., and Dechloromonas sp., and so forth) found in rhizosphere show a capability to decompose refractory contaminants. These contaminants and death roots in the upper part of wetland could be oxidized to fat acids, which may be used as the electrons acceptors for promoting the bioelectricity generation during wastewater treatment. © 2016",Wang Junfeng; Song Xinshan; Wang Yuhui; Bai Junhong; Li Manjie; Dong Guoqiang; Lin Fanda; Lv Yanfeng; Yan Denghua,College of Environmental Science and Engineering\State Environmental Protection Engineering Center for Pollution Treatment and Control in Textile Industry\China; School of Environment\Beijing Normal University\China; State Key Laboratory Hydroscience and Engineering\Tsinghua University\China; China Institute of Water Resource and Hydropower Research\Beijing\China,-,Bioenergy production; Constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell; Electrochemically active bacteria; Macrophytes; Rhizodegradation
529.html,High cancer risks by exposure to PCDD/Fs in the neighborhood of an Integrated Waste Management Facility,"In 2014, we conducted a study aimed at screening the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and various trace elements in air and soil samples collected in an urban area of Sant Adrià de Besòs (Barcelona, Spain) in the vicinity of an Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF). It consists of a mechanical-biological treatment plant (MBT) and an old municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI). Human health risks for the population living in the area were also assessed. The most worrying result was the high cancer risks estimated for the area (2.5 × 10− 6). In March 2017, we have carried out a new survey to check if the authorities had taken the necessary and urgent measures to reduce the environmental concentrations of PCDD/Fs -and the human health risks- until acceptable levels. Although the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in soils are currently lower (mean value: 1.66 vs. 3.6 ng WHO-TEQ/kg in 2014), they are still are notably higher than those found near other MSWIs of Catalonia. In turn, the levels of PCDD/Fs in air are even higher than in 2014 (mean value: 0.044 vs. 0.026 pg WHO-TEQ/m3in 2014), being also the highest detected in similar zones of Catalonia. The current cancer risk due to PCDD/F exposure for the residents in the neighborhood of the IWMF is 2.3 × 10− 6, a worrying fact as the 10− 6threshold continues to be exceeded. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Domingo José L.; Rovira Joaquim; Nadal Martí; Schuhmacher Marta,Laboratory of Toxicology and Environmental Health\School of Medicine\Spain; Departament d'Enginyeria Química\Universitat Rovira i Virgili\Spain,-,Cancer risks; Integrated Waste Management Facility; Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator; PCDD/Fs; Urban area

A cactus is a graph in which any two cycles have at most one common vertex. Let C(n,k) denote the class of all cacti with n vertices and k cycles. In this paper, sharp lower bound on revised Szeged index of graph G in C(n,k) is established and the corresponding extremal graph is determined. Furthermore, the graph G in C(n,k) with the second minimal revised Szeged index is identified as well. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Shujing,School of Mathematics and Statistics\Central China Normal University\China,-,Cactus; Revised Szeged index; Szeged index; Wiener index
530.html,A relationship in adrenal androgen levels between mothers and their children from a dioxin-exposed region in Vietnam,"Over the past decades, southern Vietnam has been burdened by dioxins from contaminated herbicides sprayed during the Vietnam War. In a previous study, we found that dioxin exposure decreased levels of salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal androgen, in 3-year-old children. In present study, to assess the relationship between adrenal hormones disruption in lactating mothers and in children, we compared mother-child pairs from dioxin- and nondioxin-contaminated regions. In 2010 and 2011, mother-child pairs from a dioxin hotspot region (n = 37) and a non-contaminated region (n = 47) were recruited and donated breast milk and serum samples for dioxin and steroid hormones determination. Mothers were 20–30 years old and had given birth to their first child between 4 and 16 weeks previously. One year later, saliva samples were collected from the children. Dioxin levels in breast milk were determined by gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Salivary DHEA, cortisol in children and androstenedione (A-dione), estradiol, cortisol, and DHEA in maternal serum were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of dioxin congeners in the hotspot region were 2- to 5-fold higher than in samples from the non-contaminated region. Salivary DHEA levels in children and serum A-dione levels in mothers were significantly higher in the hotspot region; no difference was found in the levels of other hormones. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the elevated hormone levels in mothers and children (r = 0.62, p < 0.001). Several dioxin congeners exhibited strong significant dose-response relationships with salivary DHEA and serum A-dione levels. Our findings suggest that dioxin disrupts adrenal androgens in mothers and breastfeeding children through the same mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Anh Le Thai; Kido Teruhiko; Honma Seijiro; Manh Ho Dung; Koike Ikue; Oyama Yuko; Phuc Hoang Duc; Okamoto Rie; Nakagawa Hideaki; Nakayama Shoji F.; Nhu Dang Duc; Minh Nguyen Hung,Division of Health Science\Graduate School of Medical Science\Japan; Faculty of Health Sciences\Institute of Medical\Japan; Faculty of Pharmacy\Lac Hong University\Viet Nam; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health\Kanazawa Medical University\Japan,-,Adrenal androgen; Dioxin; Endocrine disruption; Vietnamese mother-child pairs
531.html,Identification of weathered multiple petroleum products in contaminated soils by characterizing unresolved complex mixture hump in gas chromatograph data,"A new method for identifying the petroleum products in contaminated soils is presented, which characterizes the unresolved complex mixture (UCM) hump in the baseline of gas chromatograph (GC) data. The UCM hump identified in soil data was fitted to the Gaussian function, and characterized according to the time for the maximum point (TUCM) and the width of the hump (w). Experimental results showed that a UCM hump should be clearly observed in soils when contaminated with petroleum, and that soils contaminated with kerosene, diesel, or some lubricating oils estimated herein should present different characteristic values of TUCMand w. Even though the environmental weathering of contaminated soils under evaporative conditions might cause variations in these characteristic values, they converged to specific constants depending on the product. The method could also differentiate between multiple petroleum contaminants in soil. Feasibility was evaluated using soils from a military oil storage site that was closed in 1970. The soil contaminants identified by the proposed method corresponded to the historical storage records, suggesting that the UCM hump characterization method could have strong potential in environmental forensics for differentiating products in petroleum-contaminated soils. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Jeon Soo-Kyung; Kwon Dongwook; Lee Seunghak,Center for Water Resource Cycle\Green City Technology Institute\South Korea; Energy Environment Policy and Technology\Green School\South Korea,-,Environmental forensics; Refined petroleum products; Soil contamination; Source identification; Unresolved complex mixture (UCM)
532.html,Anaerobic oxidation of methane by aerobic methanotrophs in sub-Arctic lake sediments,"Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a biological process that plays an important role in reducing the CH4emissions from a wide range of ecosystems. Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes are recognized as significant contributors to global methane (CH4) emission, since CH4production is increasing as permafrost thaws and provides fuels for methanogenesis. Methanotrophy, including AOM, is critical to reducing CH4emissions. The identity, activity, and metabolic processes of anaerobic methane oxidizers are poorly understood, yet this information is critical to understanding CH4cycling and ultimately to predicting future CH4emissions. This study sought to identify the microorganisms involved in AOM in sub-Arctic lake sediments using DNA- and phospholipid-fatty acid (PLFA)- based stable isotope probing. Results indicated that aerobic methanotrophs belonging to the genus Methylobacter assimilate carbon from CH4, either directly or indirectly. Other organisms that were found, in minor proportions, to assimilate CH4-derived carbon were methylotrophs and iron reducers, which might indicate the flow of CH4-derived carbon from anaerobic methanotrophs into the broader microbial community. While various other taxa have been reported in the literature to anaerobically oxidize methane in various environments (e.g. ANME-type archaea and Methylomirabilis Oxyfera), this report directly suggest that Methylobacter can perform this function, expanding our understanding of CH4oxidation in anaerobic lake sediments. © 2016",Martinez-Cruz Karla; Leewis Mary-Cathrine; Herriott Ian Charold; Sepulveda-Jauregui Armando; Anthony Katey Walter; Thalasso Frederic; Leigh Mary Beth,Water and Environmental Research Center\Institute of Northern Engineering\United States; Biotechnology and Bioengineering Department\Cinvestav\Mexico; Institute of Arctic Biology\University of Alaska Fairbanks\United States,-,Anaerobic incubation; DNA; Methylobacter; Phospholipid fatty acid; Stable isotope probing
533.html,Projections of NH3emissions from manure generated by livestock production in China to 2030 under six mitigation scenarios,"China's rapid urbanization, large population, and increasing consumption of calorie-and meat-intensive diets, have resulted in China becoming the world's largest source of ammonia (NH3) emissions from livestock production. This is the first study to use provincial, condition-specific emission factors based on most recently available studies on Chinese manure management and environmental conditions. The estimated NH3emission temporal trends and spatial patterns are interpreted in relation to government policies affecting livestock production. Scenario analysis is used to project emissions and estimate mitigation potential of NH3emissions, to year 2030. We produce a 1 km × 1 km gridded NH3emission inventory for 2008 based on county-level activity data, which can help identify locations of highest NH3emissions. The total NH3emissions from manure generated by livestock production in 2008 were 7.3 Tg NH3·yr− 1(interquartile range from 6.1 to 8.6 Tg NH3·yr− 1), and the major sources were poultry (29.9%), pigs (28.4%), other cattle (27.9%), and dairy cattle (7.0%), while sheep and goats (3.6%), donkeys (1.3%), horses (1.2%), and mules (0.7%) had smaller contributions. From 1978 to 2008, annual NH3emissions fluctuated with two peaks (1996 and 2006), and total emissions increased from 2.2 to 7.3 Tg·yr− 1increasing on average 4.4%·yr− 1. Under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, NH3emissions in 2030 are expected to be 13.9 Tg NH3·yr− 1(11.5–16.3 Tg NH3·yr− 1). Under mitigation scenarios, the projected emissions could be reduced by 18.9–37.3% compared to 2030 BAU emissions. This study improves our understanding of NH3emissions from livestock production, which is needed to guide stakeholders and policymakers to make well informed mitigation decisions for NH3emissions from livestock production at the country and regional levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Peng; Koloutsou-Vakakis Sotiria; Rood Mark J.; Luan Shengji,College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering\Peking University\China; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\United States,-,Ammonia emissions; Livestock manure; Mitigation scenarios; Policies analysis; Uncertainty
534.html,"Comparison of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei between wet and dry seasons in Guangzhou, southern China","Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), condensation nuclei (CN) and aerosol chemical composition were measured simultaneously at an urban site of Guangzhou from July to August 2015 and in January 2016, and the seasonal variations of aerosol activated fractions (NCCN/NCN) as well as their relevant influence factors were further studied accordingly. NCNis generally higher in winter (dry season), whereas NCCNand NCCN/NCNare mostly higher in summer (wet season) instead. In particular, NCCNand NCCN/NCNare much lower at smaller supersaturation levels (SS < 0.2) in winter. In spite of similar diurnal variations for NCCNand NCN, NCCN/NCNindicates an opposite tendency, relatively lower at midday, dusk and before midnight. Other than the size of particles as well as their chemical composition, some other factors, such as mass, gas precursors, pollutant transportation, meteorological conditions, etc., also contribute to the variations of NCCNand NCCN/NCN.Particles from the local source or local-oceanic combination source cast influence on CN and CCN significantly, while the pollutants originating from and crossing over distant polluted areas contribute largely to CCN/CN. NCNand NCCNare relatively higher under pollution-free conditions in summertime and polluted conditions in wintertime, but NCCN/NCNis just the opposite. On various polluted conditions, aerosol CCN activities are greatly discrepant between summer and winter, especially during mist or heavy haze periods. The results imply that anthropogenic pollutants exert critical impacts on aerosol CCN activation. © 2016",Duan Junyan; Tao Jun; Wu Yunfei; Cheng Tiantao; Zhang Renjian; Wang Yanyu; Zhu Hailin; Xie Xin; Liu Yuehui; Li Xiang; Kong Lingdong; Li Mei,)\Department of Environmental Science and Engineering\China; South China Institute of Environmental Sciences\Ministry of Environmental Protection\China; Key Laboratory of Region Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia (TEA)\Institute of Atmospheric Physics\China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change\Nanjing University\China,-,Aerosol; Cloud condensation nuclei; Pollution; Urban area
535.html,A new method to determine the un-poled elastic properties of ferroelectric materials,"Piezoelectric devices with complex electrode geometries often contain ferroelectric regions that experience little or no electric field and remain unpolarised. Since the un-poled and poled material properties differ it is desirable to account for these regions in a device when developing predictive models or to design piezoelectric transducers. The lack of published data on the elastic properties for un-poled ferroelectrics, specifically the numerous commercial compositions such as lead zirconate titanate, reflects the difficulty of experimental measurement. In this work, a method for predicting un-poled properties from more commonly available poled data has been developed. A new method of calculating these properties is presented which provides a rapid and practical solution to the problem of evaluating the isotropic stiffness and Poisson’s ratio for an un-poled ferroelectric material. The way in which this calculation has been derived and validated is presented and detailed comparisons are made with alternative methods and experimental data. © 2017 The Author(s).

Even though the general deduplication approach has been increasingly accepted, it comes with many security and privacy problems due to the outsourced data delivery models of cloud storage. To deal with specific security and privacy issues, secure deduplication techniques have been proposed for cloud data, leading to a diverse range of solutions and trade-offs. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research on secure deduplication for cloud data in consideration of the attack scenarios exploited most widely in cloud storage. On the basis of classification of deduplication system, we explore security risks and attack scenarios from both inside and outside adversaries. We then describe state-of-The-Art secure deduplication techniques for each approach that deal with different security issues under specific or combined threat models, which include both cryptographic and protocol solutions. We discuss and compare each scheme in terms of security and efficiency specific to different security goals. Finally, we identify and discuss unresolved issues and further research challenges for secure deduplication in cloud storage. © 2017 ACM.",Shin Youngjoo; Koo Dongyoung; Hur Junbeom,National Security Research Institute\1559 Yuseongdae-ro\South Korea; Department of Computer Science and Engineering\Korea University\South Korea,-,Deterministic information dispersal; Message-dependent encryption; Proof of ownership; Traffic obfuscation

In response, a volunteer defense has emerged, led by security companies, infrastructure operators, and vigilantes. This reactionary force does not concern itself withmaking proactive upgrades to the cyber infrastructure. Instead, it operates on the front lines by remediating infections as they appear. We construct a model of the abuse reporting infrastructure in order to explain how voluntary action against cybercrime functions today, in hopes of improving our understanding of what works and how to make remediation more effective in the future. We examine the incentives to participate among data contributors, affected resource owners, and intermediaries. Finally, we present a series of key attributes that differ among voluntary actions to investigate further through experimentation, pointing toward a research agenda that could establish causality between interventions and outcomes. © 2017 ACM.",Jhaveri Mohammad Hanif; Cetin Orcun; Gañán Carlos; Moore Tyler; Van Eeten Michel,Delft University of Technology\Faculty TBM\Netherlands; School of Computer Science\University of Tulsa\United States; 5601 Rock Valley Dr.\Fort Worth\United States,-,Abuse reporting; Cybercrime; Internet security; Security economics

The complexity of finding the maximum Ck-free 2-matching in a given graph varies depending on k and the type of input graph. The case where k=4 and the graph is bipartite, which is called the maximum square-free 2-matching problem in bipartite graphs, is well-solved. Previous results for this special case include min-max theorems, polynomial combinatorial algorithms, a linear programming formulation with dual integrality for a weighted version, and discrete convex structures. In this paper, we further investigate the structure of square-free 2-matchings in bipartite graphs and present new decomposition theorems. These theorems serve as analogues of the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition for matchings in bipartite graphs and the Edmonds-Gallai decomposition for matchings in nonbipartite graphs. We exhibit two canonical minimizers for the set function in the min-max formula, and a characterization of the maximum square-free 2-matchings with the aid of these canonical minimizers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Takazawa Kenjiro,Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering\Faculty of Science and Engineering\Japan,-,Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition; Edmonds-Gallai decomposition; Matching theory; Square-free 2-matching

542.html,A survey on systems security metrics,"Security metrics have received significant attention. However, they have not been systematically explored based on the understanding of attack-defense interactions, which are affected by various factors, including the degree of system vulnerabilities, the power of system defense mechanisms, attack (or threat) severity, and situations a system at risk faces. This survey particularly focuses on how a system security state can evolve as an outcome of cyber attack-defense interactions. This survey concerns how to measure system-level security by proposing a security metrics framework based on the following four sub-metrics: (1) metrics of system vulnerabilities, (2) metrics of defense power, (3) metrics of attack or threat severity, and (4) metrics of situations. To investigate the relationships among these four sub-metrics, we propose a hierarchical ontology with four sub-ontologies corresponding to the four sub-metrics and discuss how they are related to each other. Using the four sub-metrics, we discuss the state-of-art existing security metrics and their advantages and disadvantages (or limitations) to obtain lessons and insight in order to achieve an ideal goal in developing security metrics. Finally, we discuss open research questions in the security metrics research domain and we suggest key factors to enhance security metrics from a system security perspective. © 2016 ACM 0360-0300/2016/12-ART62 $15.00.",Pendleton Marcus; Garcia-Lebron Richard; Cho Jin-Hee; Xu Shouhuai,University of Texas at San Antonio\One UTSA Circle\United States; Computational and Information Sciences Direct.\U.S. Army Research Laboratory\United States,-,Quantitative security; Security foundation; Security measurement; Security metrics

Network data mining has a large number of applications in many disciplines including protein-protein interaction networks, social networks, transportation networks, and telecommunication networks. Different empirical studies have shown that it is possible to predict new relationships between elements attending to the topology of the network and the properties of its elements. The problem of predicting new relationships in networks is called link prediction. Link prediction aims to infer the behavior of the network link formation process by predicting missed or future relationships based on currently observed connections. It has become an attractive area of study since it allows us to predict how networks will evolve.

Facing the large variety of menus, it is difficult to have a clear understanding of the design possibilities and to ascertain their similarities and differences. In this article, we address a main challenge of menu design: the need to characterize the design space of menus. To do this, we propose a taxonomy of menu properties that structures existing work on visual menus. As properties have an impact on the performance of the menu, we start by refining performance through a list of quality criteria and by reviewing existing analytical and empirical methods for quality evaluation. This taxonomy of menu properties is a step toward the elaboration of advanced predictive models of menu performance and the optimization of menus. A key point of this work is to focus both on menus and on the properties of menus, and then enable a fine-grained analysis in terms of performance. © 2016 ACM.",Bailly Gilles; Lecolinet Eric; Nigay Laurence,Telecom ParisTech\Paris-Saclay University\France; University Grenoble Alpes\CNRS\France; Laboratoire LIG\Bâtiment IMAG\France,-,-

549.html,Automated planning for ubiquitous computing,"The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one's experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework's main purpose is to facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing. © 2016 ACM.",Georgievski Ilche; Aiello Marco,University of Groningen\Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science\Netherlands,-,Ambient intelligence; Pervasive computing; Planning domain modelling; Planning techniques; Smart environments

To resolve this, we performed an extensive literature survey and analyzed 43 IS related publications plus additional background literature. Using qualitative data analysis methods, we developed a model of the elements that constitute IS. We present a classification framework for IS programs and projects and apply it to lay out a map of known IS endeavors.

551.html,Affinity-based thread and data mapping in shared memory systems,"Shared memory architectures have recently experienced a large increase in thread-level parallelism, leading to complex memory hierarchies with multiple cache memory levels and memory controllers. These new designs created a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) behavior, where the performance and energy consumption of memory accesses depend on the place where the data is located in the memory hierarchy. Accesses to local caches or memory controllers are generally more efficient than accesses to remote ones. A common way to improve the locality and balance of memory accesses is to determine the mapping of threads to cores and data to memory controllers based on the affinity between threads and data. Such mapping techniques can operate at different hardware and software levels, which impacts their complexity, applicability, and the resulting performance and energy consumption gains. In this article, we introduce a taxonomy to classify different mapping mechanisms and provide a comprehensive overview of existing solutions. © 2016 ACM.",Diener Matthias; Cruz Eduardo H.M.; Alves Marco A.Z.; Navaux Philippe O.A.; Koren Israel,Informatics Institute\Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul\Brazil; Department of Informatics\Federal University of Paraná\Brazil; 309E Knowles Engineering Building\Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\United States,-,Cache memories; Communication; Data mapping; NUMA; Shared memory; Survey; Thread mapping

The clinical signs in infected horses were pyrexia (40.5-41.5°C), depression, pale or icteric mucous membranes and emaciation. Haematological examination revealed significant decrease in erythrocyte, thrombocyte counts and haemoglobin concentration in infected horses compared with controls. Treatment with imidocarb dipropionate was 100% effective in eliminating the parasites from the blood and led to an improvement in the clinical state. In conclusion, babesiosis should be suspected in any horses showing signs of anaemia or jaundice and severe body weight loss in addition to the presence of ticks. Bloody urine which is a characteristic feature of babesiosis in other animals is not common in Arabian horses. Moreover, treatment using imidocarb dipropionate in conjunction with hematinics and fluid therapy should be applied for treatment of equine babesiosis. © 2015 The Author(s).",Osman Salama A.,Department of Veterinary Medicine\College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine\Saudi Arabia; Department of Animal Medicine\Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\Egypt,-,Babesia caballi; Babesiosis; Haematology; Horses; Signs; Treatment
553.html,The application of probiotics and flaxseed promotes metabolism of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in pigs,"The effect of combining probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum) with flaxseed (a source of n-3 PUFAs) on the lipid metabolism and long-chain fatty acid profile of conventional piglets after weaning was studied. The levels of total lipids and high-density lipoproteins cholesterol decreased from Day 7 post-weaning, whereas levels of low-density lipoproteins cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides did not change significantly in piglets with supplemented diet. The levels of alphalinolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increased seven days post-weaning; however, the levels of dihomogamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid (AA) were lower and linoleic acid (LA) higher in synbioticsfed piglets compared with controls. This study demonstrates the efficacy of conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA, where delta-6-desaturase was predominantly used for n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis from ALA at the expense of n-6 PUFAs from LA, which caused rapid increase in EPA/AA ratio on Day 14 after weaning. Combination of probiotic cheese and flaxseed is a good dietary supplement for piglets before weaning, helping them to adapt to change in diet more easily by regulating changes in lipid metabolism and vitality, and reducing the likelihood of chronic diseases. © 2016 The Author(s).",Sopková Drahomíra; Hertelyová Zdenka; Andrejčáková Zuzana; Vlčková Radoslava; Gancarčíková Soňa; Petrilla Vladimír; Ondrašovičová Silvia; Krešáková Lenka,Department of Anatomy\Histology and Physiology\Slovakia; Institute of Experimental Medicine\University of Pavol Jozef Safarik University\Slovakia; Institute of Gnotobiology and Microbiology\University of Veterinary Medicine\Slovakia,-,Flaxseed; Lipid metabolism; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Probiotics; Weaned piglets

In the experiment, in total 208 × ROSS 308 male chickens were used to examine the effect of RFFS on growth performance, AIAAD, intestinal morphology and trypsin activity in the intestinal content. Four dietary treatments were used: control group (without RFFS) and groups containing 4%, 8% and 12% of RFFS. The experiment lasted from 10th to 38th day of age. The presence of RFFS in broiler diets markedly decreased body weight and feed conversion ratio merely in group fed by 12% of RFFS in its diet. The AIAAD was lower when diets contained RFFS in all observed amino acids expect methionine. Higher AIAAD was obtained in RFFS12 in comparison with RFFS8 and RFFS4 due to a higher weight of pancreas and higher trypsin activity. Pancreas weight and trypsin activity increased with increasing RFFS in the diets. The morphology parameters villus height and crypt depth were negatively affected by the presence of RFFS. © 2016 The Author(s).

555.html,Haematological changes in albino wister rats exposed to sub-chronic administration of sub-lethal doses of Zamitraz® (12.5% amitraz),"There is the need to investigate the toxicological potential of increasing doses of amitraz on the haematology as recent trend in development of resistance by pests may lead to increasing the quantity of amitraz required to control them. Eighty male rats, 180 ± 20 g assigned into 4 groups were used for the study. Groups A, B and C were treated daily with an oral dose of 10.0, 2.0 and 0.4 mg/kg body weight of amitraz, while group D was treated with 10 mL/kg water. Parameters evaluated were packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cells (RBCs) counts, reticulocyte counts (RTC), haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, white blood cell (WBC) count and differential white blood cell (DWBC) counts. There was reduction (p <.05) in the mean PCV, RBC, TWBC and Hb of rats in group A four weeks from the start of administration of the amitraz when compared to groups B, C and D. There was dose dependent increase (p <.05) in the mean percentage RTC of rats among groups A, B, C and D between days 56 and 84 of the experiment with group A producing the highest percentage counts. It was concluded that sub-chronic administration of sub-lethal doses of amitraz could lead to regenerative anaemia. © 2015 The Author(s).",Omoja Valentine Uneojo; Asuzu Isaac Uzoma; Anika Silvanus Maduka,Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology\University of Nigeria\Nigeria,-,Administration; Amitraz; Regenerative anaemia; Sub-chronic; Toxicity

The aim of the present study was to assess haematochemical profile of adult Cholistani service bulls (n = 16), being reared at the Semen Production Unit Karaniwala, Bahawalpur, Cholistan desert, Pakistan, during various seasons as an indicator of their health status. Keeping in view the prevailing climatic conditions of the study area, four seasons of three months duration each were defined as (i) cool dry winter (November, December, January) (ii) temperate spring (February, March, April) (iii) hot dry summer (May, June, July) and (iv) hot humid summer (August, September, October). Blood specimens were collected fortnightly during the study period for haematochemical analyses (automated). The present study revealed that Cholistani service bulls have a tendency to maintain most of their haematochemical parameters more or less at the same level during various seasons which is suggestive of their adaptability under stressful climates without showing any signs of stress. © 2015 The Author(s).",Farooq Umer; Ahmad Nazir; Ahmad Ijaz; Mahmood Syed Aamer; Andrabi Syed Murtaza Hassan; Idris Musadiq,Department of Physiology\University College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences\Pakistan; Department of Theriogenology\University of Agriculture\Pakistan; Department of Physiology\University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences\Pakistan; Livestock and Dairy Development Department\Semen Production Unit\Pakistan,-,Cholistan; Haematochemistry; Pakistan; Seasonal variations
558.html,Evaluation of supplemental vitamin E on 56-day feedlot growth performance and plasma tocopherol concentrations in calf-fed Holstein steers,"Fifty-four Holstein steer calves, divided in two weight groupings (141.2 ± 4.9 kg and 454.2 ± 7.0 kg respectively), were used in a 56-day study to evaluate the influence of supplemental vitamin E on growth performance and plasma vitamin concentrations. Steers were assigned within body weight groupings to 18 pens, 3 steers/pen. Dietary treatments consisted of a steam-flaked corn-based growing-finishing diet supplemented to provide 0, 250, or 500 IU/d of vitamin E as all racemic α-tocopherol. No morbidity was apparent during the course of the study. Calves in the heavier weight grouping had greater average daily gain (24.4%, P <.01), dry matter intake (54.3%, P <.01), and lower gain efficiency (40.7%, P <.01). Vitamin E supplementation did not affect (P >.10) feedlot growth performance. Initial and 56-day plasma tocopherol were not influenced (P >.10) by weight grouping. Final 56-day plasma tocopherol increased linearly (P <.01) with level of vitamin E supplementation. Plasma tocopherol of non-supplemented steers decreased (P =.01) from an average initial concentration of 1.66-1.16 ug/mL at day 56. It is concluded that vitamin E supplementation of calf-fed Holstein steers receiving a conventional steam-flaked corn-based growing-finishing diet is not expected to enhance growth performance. © 2015 The Author(s).",-,Instituto de Ciencias Veterinarias\Universidad Autónoma de Baja California\Mexico; Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia\Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas\Mexico; Department of Animal Science\University of California\United States,-,Feedlot; Holstein; Performance; Tocopherol

It has been known for two decades that a hexagonal system has an anti-forcing edge if and only if it is a truncated parallelogram. A connected subgraph G of a hexagonal system is called a single coronoid system if G has exactly one non-hexagonal interior face and each edge belongs to a hexagon of G. In this paper, we show that a single coronoid system with an anti-forcing edge can be obtained by gluing a truncated parallelogram with a generalized hexagonal system which has a unique perfect matching and can be obtained by attaching two additional pendant edges to a hexagonal system, and the latter can be constructed from one hexagon case by applying five modes of hexagon addition. Such graphs are half essentially disconnected coronoid systems in the rheo classification. So computing the number of perfect matchings of such graphs is reduced to that of two hexagonal systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Liang Xiaodong; Zhang Heping,College of Mathematics and Systems Science\Xinjiang University\China; School of Mathematics and Statistics\Lanzhou University\China,-,Anti-forcing edge; Coronoid system; Hexagonal system; Perfect matching

Settlement of the boundary delimitation with neighbouring countries has established her right over enormous sea resources within this territory. Of all known sea resources fisheries contributions are significant. Scientific exploration and exploitation of it can add a huge momentum to our economy and thus obviously contribute of our blue economy drive. Introduction of mechanised pelagic fishing trawlers revolutionised the fishing sector through scientific exploration. As a result exploitation has been more massive and transformed traditional fishing into industrial fishing. But in the same time there are some impacts of mechanised pelagic fishing both on environment and socio-economic conditions. If these impacts cannot be mitigated or reduced it appears that there will be havoc in our marine fisheries recourses. © SEECMAR | All rights reserved.,Dey Parag; Rahaman Md.

This article highlights the verbal formation seen in Latvian svinêt svin svinejo 'celebrate, venerate', generally recognized as another reflex of the root *kwen- in Balto-Slavic, but without due attention to the formal implications.

Different aspects of the problem are examined, including the honorific titles of the epi ton kriseon, their other offices, activities and social bonds. Individuals who held this position include prominent figures such as Konstantinos, nephew of patriarch Michael I Keroularios (1043-1058) and the addressee of many letters from Michael Psellos, as well as the 12th-13thcentury historian Niketas Choniates.

The present article discusses the stratification of linguistic culture in the Middle Ages as regards its division into the three registers (high, middle, low) inherited from ancient rhetoric and poetry and received in the Middle Ages. We conclude that there was no strict division among the three languages according to function in the Middle Ages, and that the languages themselves did not constitute styles or registers. The Old Croatian language possessed all three registers (high, middle, low) already in the Middle Ages. However, the hybrid Čakavian-Church Slavic variety as well as the Croatian redaction of Church Slavic were not used as everyday (in)formal business/colloquial codes, so that they did not develop a middle and low linguistic register. © 2017 Lodz University.

The long standing business model of these entities is changing due to major changes in the liner shipping industry and increased investment and disbursement of technology that poses new challenges and opportunities. Continued viability for OTI providers, clustered in key global freight procurement locations, will require an understanding of major strengths and weaknesses as well continued investment in management tools and processes that allow them to continue in their historic role as a key conduit in the global movement of freight. We show that despite the growing use of information technology OTIs locate in clusters near ocean and air ports. This points to something else besides IT and analytics which these firms require. We believe that coordination requires more than IT enhancements, and involves close physical contact with partners implying that OTIs will continue to cluster around ports. © SEECMAR j All rights reserved.",-,Global Business and Transportation Department\Maritime College\United States,-,Disintermediation; Non-vessel operating common carriers; Ocean freight forwarders; Ocean transportation intermediaries

Its aim is to find a coloring of the vertices of a graph G with the minimum sum of the weights of the used colors. The MSCP has important applications in the fields such as scheduling and VLSI design. The minimum number of colors among all optimal solutions of the MSCP for G is called the chromatic strength of G and is denoted by s(G). A tight upper bound of s(G) allows to significantly reduce the search space when solving the MSCP. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate two new upper bounds of s(G) for general graphs, UBAand UBS, based on an abstraction of all possible colorings of G formulated as an ordered set of decreasing positive integer sequences. The experimental results on the standard benchmarks DIMACS and COLOR show that UBAis competitive, and that UBSis significantly tighter than those previously proposed in the literature for 70 graphs out of 74 and, in particular, reaches optimality for 8 graphs. Moreover, both UBAand UBScan be applied to the more general optimum cost chromatic partition (OCCP) problem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Lecat Clément; Lucet Corinne; Li Chu-Min,Laboratoire de Modélisation\Information et Système EA 4290\France,-,Chromatic strength; Graph theory; Sum coloring problem

Future cargo flow projections also helps in making decisions on cargo rates. Therefore, accuracy in estimating the cargo demand at port locations is critical. Indian ports experienced 151% increase in cargo volume between fiscal years from 2002-03 to 2014-15. This paper analyses such growth systematically with classical regression and time series modeling techniques. The regression models are developed using macroeconomic conditions as causal variables. The models are estimated using quarterly and monthly cargo flow data for twelve major seaports in India. The analysis revealed that the time series models perform better in terms of prediction accuracy than the regression models. The average prediction error from the regression models varied from 6% to 20%, while the error associations with time series models are varying from 3. 8% to 12.6%.

As a result, a requirement for registration is a genuine link between a particular territory and ship. In the Convention obligations are enforced on coastal states to implement legislation for the shipping industry to make sure that ship within the jurisdiction of each member state obligate genuine link with that state and to safeguard states adversely impacted by the control of the state of registration. Nevertheless, this instrument reflects many legal issues as well as political disagreements which have brought a situation where many states have rejected to ratify the Convention and therefore, blocked its entry into force. In this respect, this paper?s purpose is to identify the relevant legal issues which made impossible the ratification of this Convention.

It tells the story of a land reform policy and its implementation over two decades, through changes in rules and governing parties. It observes land reform outcomes that are surprisingly favourable to pastoral leaseholders, and surprisingly unfavourable to the Crown. It then explores several possible explanations, including the logic of collective action, bargaining dynamics, principal-agent problems, and ideas of ownership. It concludes that John Locke's labour theory of property holds sway in New Zealand's land reform, despite what the law prescribes.

But as knowledge of the springs spread, the area saw increases in fights, traffic, burglaries, and drug use. In response, two residents purchased the land and committed to restore the property while allowing limited public access, subsequently generating a great deal of controversy within the community. Privatizing Vickers Hot Springs follows the archetypical lesson of Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay, “The Tragedy of the Commons.” Hardin stated that the problem for common-pool resources was that a finite amount of services are demanded by a potentially infinite number of users, who have little to gain by sacrificing for the common good. But Hardin's theory does not always apply. Many communities have come together to manage resources, often without government oversight. Thus, the question is not whether or not Hardin's theory is accurate, but rather “under what conditions it is correct and when it makes the wrong predictions.” Case studies provide nuance to the broad brushstrokes of a theory, and whether Hardin's parable is applicable depends on the particularities of the common property resource conflict. Employing the frameworks established by Hardin, Dietz et al., and Ostrom, this paper examines the management of Vickers Hot Springs within its broader social, ecological, and political context, asking whether the particular circumstances of this resource use conflict made privatization the most predictable outcome. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Bernstein Jennifer M.,University of Hawaii at Manoa\Honolulu\United States,-,-
579.html,Why does the regulated harvest of black bears affect the rate of human-bear conflicts in New Jersey?,"Humanity has a miserable track record in conserving large carnivores: from Paleolithic hunters skinning the enormous cave lion 15,000 years ago to the contemporary loss of the marsupial Tasmanian tiger. Today, several iconic members of the order Carnivora are on the brink of extinction (Amur leopards, Asiatic cheetahs), and over 75% of the world's 31 large carnivore species have experienced alarming population declines, often directly from human persecution. Yet, several species of large predators have dramatically rebounded (European gray wolf, American black bear) in the most unlikely of places: heavily human-dominated landscapes. For example, the black bear population in northwestern New Jersey (NJ), the state with the highest human densities in the United States, has exponentially increased over sixfold in just 15 years. During this period of unprecedented suburban sprawl in NJ there have been over 26,500 reported human-bear interactions including seven attacks on humans and one human fatality. Given accelerating anthropogenic landscape transformation, there simply are not enough large tracts of wildlands remaining to alone support expanding bear populations. Thus, American black bear conservation in the Anthropocene may ultimately depend upon society's tolerance for this large carnivore in areas where people live, work, and recreate. In an effort to curb bear population growth and reduce conflicts, the first regulated NJ black bear harvest in over three decades was held in 2003 resulting in an acrimonious public debate.

One assessment approach using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry/Olfactometry (GC–MS/O), has been used primarily to identify priority odourants within a standardised panel. We investigated the variation of response between participants of average and high olfactory sensitivity, and discovered that current GC–MS/O methodologies do not represent the entirety of community odour impact. Based on these results we constructed a Biosolids Processing Odour Wheel followed by a Community Odour Wheel for use by untrained community members and site operators.

580.html,Improving student learning through an interdisciplinary case study: Exploring eutrophication in Lake Erie,"This pedagogical project examined how embedding an interdisciplinary case study in an undergraduate ecology course impacted student learning outcomes. Specifically, we examined learning outcomes following participation in a group-based case study project, which asked students to adopt the role of an expert phycologist, microbiologist, agronomist, or limnologist in order to jointly investigate the problem of eutrophication in Lake Erie. We examined student learning outcomes on exam questions that tested students' knowledge of eutrophication compared to their performance on exam questions that tested knowledge of course content taught using traditional lecture-based methods. We also examined how students' recognition of the value of interdisciplinary approaches to solving science problems changed across the semester, as well as changes in students' views of the ways in which the skills and knowledge of their major could contribute to solving eutrophication problems and the complex problem of climate change. Results indicated significant increases in student understanding of eutrophication through comparisons of pre- and posttest scores, and dramatic twofold increases in student learning on the eutrophication exam questions relative to the content taught using traditional instructional methods. Interestingly, at the end of the course, the non-science majors in the course were more likely to endorse interdisciplinary approaches for solving complex science problems than were the science majors in the course. Implications for educational practices for both major and nonmajor science courses are discussed. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Anderson Laurel J.; Bunnell Sarah L.; Yates Jennifer R.,Department of Botany and Microbiology\Ohio Wesleyan University\United States; Department of Psychology\Ohio Wesleyan University\United States,-,-
581.html,On the risk assessment of collapse gully erosion in Jiangxi Province based on Logistic model,"[Background] Collapse gully erosion is a special type of soil erosion in southern China, but risk assessment research on collapse gully erosion is few. Risk assessment provides new ideas and methods for the study of collapse gully erosion and soil erosion. [Methods] This article selected Jiangxi Province as the study area. The index of the risk assessment was selected by the correlation factor analysis, and the Logistic model was used to calculate the occurrence risk of collapse gully erosion. On this basis, the hazardous risk of collapsing was estimated by the expert scoring method. In the end, the risk of collapse gully erosion can be obtained by superposing the occurrence risk and hazardous risk, so as to discuss the feasibility of risk assessment of collapse gully erosion at the regional scale. [Results] Collapse gully erosion in Jiangxi Province are mainly distributed in such as precipitation from 1 500 mm to 1 700 mm, granite red soil land, sloping from 10 degrees to 30 degrees, below 300 m altitude, vegetation coverage less than 0. 2 or from 0. 6 to 0. 8, in forest or grassland area. By using the function of geographic analysis in ARCGIS, after overlay factors and the distribution of collapse gully erosion, 4 000 grid cells are sampled randomly and respectively in study area with collapse gully erosion or not, and logistic regression model is constructed with date of collapse gully erosion distribution and 6 screened factors such as hypsography, relief, vegetation cover, soil type, land use, and rock type. For accuracy tests amount to 70. 9%, then the occurrence risk of collapse gully erosion in Jiangxi Province can be calculated by this logistic regression model. The occurrence risk of collapse gully erosion in the south and the west of Jiangxi Province is relatively higher, and those in the eastern, northern and central are relatively lower. The hazardous risk of collapse gully erosion is generally minor in the whole province, and the hazardous areas with relatively high risk showing a sporadic distribution trend. After comprehensive analysis of the occurrence risk and the hazardous risk, the collapse gully erosion presents medium and low risk in Jiangxi Province, which possesses more than 95 percent of the province’s total area. Among them, the light risks accounts for 68% of the total area of the province and is mainly distributed in the surrounding areas of Poyang Lake. The measures of risk prevention and control should be mainly focused on prevention and protection in these areas. The medium- and upper-class risks is mainly distributed in the southern and western parts of Jiangxi Province, and in these parts, risk prevention and control measures should be taken equal attention to prevention, protection and comprehensive management. [Conclusions] Finally, the study proves that Logistic model is feasible for estimating the risk of collapse gully erosion. © 2017, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.

583.html,Farming the floodplain: Ecological and agricultural tradeoffs and opportunities in river and stream governance in New England's changing climate,"In New England (United States) climate change models forecast increasingly intense, frequent floods. Communities in this region are already experiencing these changes, along with the negative consequences associated with them, such as inundation, erosion, natural habitat destruction, and property damage. As it is in many places around the world, agriculture in New England is often in floodplains, which means that farmers are at greater risk due to where they farm. These farmers are already adapting to the increased risk of flooding; however, some of their actions may affect communities downstream, both human and ecological. This case study examines the competing perspectives of farmers and other community stakeholders in New England as farmers work to adapt to increasing flood impacts. Our premise is that, considering the intensified pressures of climate change on agriculture near rivers and streams, we must find ways to allow farmers to adapt to protect their farms and downstream communities. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Warner Benjamin P.; Schattman Rachel E.; Hatch Christine E.,University of New Mexico\Department of Geography and Environmental Studies\United States; United States Department of Agriculture\Northeast Climate Hub\United States; University of Massachusetts\Department of Geosciences\United States,-,-
584.html,The Future of Nietzsche’s Perspectivism as Political Consensus,"In this paper, I delve on Nietzsche’s concept of perspectivism and how it becomes relevant amid contemporary society’s openness to relative standpoints. The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzsche’s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzsche’s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus. Later, I will present the features of this perspectivism as political consensus and how it can be viable in postmodernity. © 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

Elaboration and manipulation of the human figure in the Pyramid Texts,"The importance of the Pyramid Texts in Egyptological studies is confined not only to the content of the formulas or to their value in terms of the afterlife of the king; we can also focus attention on the epigraphic perspective and therefore on the semiotic one as well. Of interest here are the processes altering the grapheme and, in particular, the human classifier that we can recognize in almost all the Pyramid Texts of the 5th and 6th dynasties. The manipulation of signs seems to be viewed as a definite way to affect reality. In Egyptian written signs are not only the messengers of a spoken language but they come into existence and start to work from the very moment they are engraved onto stone. The ancient origins of these texts can explain their performative values: Hieroglyphs are characterized by a creative power and sometimes by dangerous properties, so they require expedients in order to prevent them from damaging the dead king. This contribution is part of a broader PhD topic, whose goal is to attempt an interpretation of the particular graphic solutions of the human figure occurring in the Pyramid Texts and to evaluate if they can be compared with specific examples of manipulation of the image in different contexts of the contemporary iconographical scenery repertoire. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

588.html,Research on Old Kingdom 'dissimilation graphique'. World-view and categorization,"Although Egyptian grammar and global functioning of hieroglyphic script have benefited from many publications since its deciphering in 1822, some peculiarities are still not acknowledged today. It can be explained particularly by the little attention given, up to now, to hieroglyphic palaeography and by the appeal of Linguistics to the detriment of Grammatology. 'Graphic dissimilation' (name given by G. Posener) is still an obscure process. Mentioned in rare occurrences in studies about the hieroglyphic system and Egyptian categorization, it has never been the subject of large-scale observations. However, it is a peculiarity specific to Egyptian writing and attested since the Old Kingdom (3rd millennium BC). It concerns the so-called 'determinatives', signs whose phonetic value has been removed in order to ascribe to them a classifying and distinctive function. Thus, they could avoid any confusion between homographs and classify the determined element in its own category. During the Old Kingdom, these determinatives were usually tripled to mark a plural - they were later replaced by three diacritical strokes to simplify a written form that has become archaic. 'Graphic dissimilation' is linked to these tripled determinatives: We are facing a dissimilation when the regular signs, instead of being three identical entities, are distinguished. For example, if ipd.w, 'birds' is typically determined by the three same birds (ducks or geese), a dissimilated occurrence would show three different determinatives (different species of ducks, marsh birds, etc.). Our study focuses on this feature, in seeking to understand why scribes have distinguished hieroglyphs normally identical. Why did they go to the trouble of using several figures instead of a simple one? What can we learn through graphic dissimilation about Egyptian beliefs, their categorization, their world-view? Throughout various examples (human beings, animals, food;), it will be demonstrated that this graphic principle offers some leads of thought about numerous parts of Egyptian culture. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The Canterbury Regional Council, a local government agency in the South Island of Aotearoa New Zealand, was struggling to exercise authority and autonomy over freshwater management in the region during the 1990s and 2000s. The case study explores the regional council's failure to create authoritative policy, which resulted in policy being rewritten and modified through litigation in the courts. In response, the regional council pursued collaborative planning mechanisms, which co-opted competing pro-development and pro-conservation interest groups, for freshwater management in the region. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Kirk Nicholas,Landcare Research\Gerald Street\New Zealand,-,-
59.html,Cropping systems affect paddy soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks (in rice-garlic and rice-fava systems) in temperate region of southern China,"The accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils is critical to food security and climate change. However, there is still limited information on the dynamic trend of SOC sequestration following changes in cropping systems. Paddy soils, typical of temperate region of southern China, have a large potential for carbon (C) sequestration and nitrogen (N) fixation. It is of great importance to study the impacts of changes in cropping systems on stocks of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) in paddy soils. A six-year field experiment was conducted to clarify the dynamics of SOC and TN stocks in the paddy topsoil (0–20 cm) when crop rotation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) -garlic (Allium sativum) (RG) was changed to rice-fava (Vicia faba L.) (RF), and to examine how the dynamics were affected by two N management strategies. The results showed that SOC stocks increased by 24.9% in the no N (control) treatment and by 18.9% in the treatment applied with conventional rate of N (CON), when RG was changed to RF. Correspondingly, TN stocks increased by 8.5% in the control but decreased by 2.6% in the CON. Compared with RG, RF was more conducive to increase the contents of soil microbial biomass C and N. Moreover, changing the cropping system from RG to RF increased the year-round N use efficiency from 21.6% to 34.4% and reduced soil N surplus in the CON treatment from 547 kg/ha to 93 kg/ha. In conclusion, changes in the cropping system from RG to RF could markedly increase SOC stocks, improve N utilization, reduce soil N surplus, and thus reduce the risk of N loss in the paddy soil. Overall, this study showed the potential of paddy agro-ecological systems to store C and maintain N stocks in the temperate regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zhang Tao; Chen Anqiang; Liu Jian; Liu Hongbin; Lei Baokun; Zhai Limei; Zhang Dan; Wang Hongyuan,Key Laboratory of Nonpoint Source Pollution Control\Ministry of Agriculture\China; Institute of Agricultural Environment and Resources\Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences\China; Department of Plant Science\Pennsylvania State University\United States,-,Nitrogen balance; Paddy soil; Rice-fava system; Rice-garlic system; Soil organic carbon stock; Total nitrogen stock
590.html,"Grassroots vs. big oil: Measure P and the fight to ban fracking in Santa Barbara County, California","In 2014, volunteers in Santa Barbara County, California, collected over 20,000 signatures in three weeks to qualify an anti-fracking initiative for the November election. The initiative, Measure P, met over six million dollars in opposition from oil corporations. Despite mobilizing 1,000 volunteers, the proponents of the measure failed to garner enough votes for success. Drawing on 43 in-depth interviews and participant observation with environmental groups before, during, and after the campaign, this article examines the strengths and weaknesses of grassroots organizing behind Measure P. Organizers, especially during the signature drive, successfully garnered broad-based support in the southern part of the county, an affluent and tourist-dependent area with no onshore oil drilling. Messages based on water, made more salient by California's historic drought, resonated with many residents. Yet, after qualifying for the ballot, proponents of the campaign allied with the local Democratic Party, changing their organizing practices and forestalling bipartisan support. Outreach to Latinos in all areas of the county, and particularly in the northern part, where onshore drilling takes place, was limited. Finally, the overwhelming inequality between the financial power of proponents and the oil industry influenced the outcome. Based on this case, I argue that coalition building and groundwork to develop support within all sectors of communities, especially those most dependent on fossil fuel extraction, is critical to strengthening grassroots efforts that challenge the energy status quo. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Grosse Corrie,Department of Sociology\University of California Santa Barbara\United States,-,-
591.html,Coping strategies of smallholder farming communities after the 2015 Nepal earthquake: Insights into post-disaster resilience and social-ecological change,"Environmental disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, and earthquakes, are pervasive and disproportionately affect rural and poor populations. The concept of resilience is typically used in disaster scenarios to describe how a community or person is able to “bounce back” from a disaster event. At the same time, resilience theory also contends that disasters, or environmental shocks, can produce or initiate profound changes in social and ecological systems. This case uses a post-disaster resilience assessment to examine how the series of earthquakes that hit central Nepal in 2015 impacted farming communities. Mid-montane smallholder farming communities near the epicenters of the earthquakes were the most affected and the associated damages impeded traditional and subsistence agricultural practices. Our results show how some aspects of the Nepali farming social-ecological system (SES) bounced back more quickly than others and how farmers used various types of coping strategies, including the adoption of labor-saving cash crops as part of their post-disaster recovery. The increased interest in cash crops after the earthquake accelerates an ongoing transition toward more market activities in subsistence communities and illustrates the potential of environmental shocks to transform and change SESs. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Epstein Kathleen; Dicarlo Jessica; Marsh Robin; Ray Isha; Måren Inger,Department of Earth Sciences\Montana State University\United States; Department of Geography\University of Colorado\United States; Institute for the Study of Societal Issues\University of California\United States; Energy and Resources Group\University of California\United States,-,-

593.html,Doñana natural space: The uncertain future of a crown jewel in Europe's protected areas,"The Doñana Natural Space (National and Natural Park) has three dominant ecosystems: dunes, beaches, and marshes. Its geographical position gives rise to a rich biota at a major stopover point in birds' migration routes and at a very important site for wintering waterfowl. Because of this, Doñana has acquired the highest protected area categories that a natural area can receive from international conservation organizations. Yet Doñana's ability to support biodiversity is under constant threat due to its proximity to culturally and economically critical locations. The greatest external problems center on agriculture and tourism, which extract enormous amounts of groundwater which then alter hydrological dynamics. Excessive nutrients, roads, commercial navigation, pilgrimages, and several programed projects are additional pressures that could be aggravated by climate change. Inside the Space, overpopulations of domestic and wild ungulates, pathogens, and invasive species have changed its ecology. Doñana is managed by two operational programs implemented by a committee of 60 stakeholders. Both areas have been divided into conservation zones and very recently have been included in an extension of the old Biosphere Reserve with a Core Area (National Park), a Buffer Area (Natural Park), and a Transition Area. In the past 40 years, Doñana has received about US$900 million: this has increased not only conservation efforts in the area but also the economic level of local residents. Conflicts are lessening but pressures are mounting. More collaboration between administrations, more active local participation, more firmness concerning illegal activities, more expert technical advice, and more funding will be needed in the near future to preserve this unique natural heritage. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Fernández-Delgado Carlos,University of Córdoba\Campus of Rabanales\Spain,-,-

Some pieces of archaeological evidence can be linked to the information given by texts in order to understand the function of the temple. The most important of them are the two cult terraces (one for each temple phase) that confirm the double nature of the sanctuary, which is at the same time a place of worship for Hathor and a podium station for Amun's barque during Djeme rites. In the same framework of solemn liturgies we can include the base of an altar found near the enclosure gate, probably an altar for holocausts as shown in a graffito inside the temple. Among the most interesting material found by Bruyère there are many cups in the form of a calyx found in the 1939 campaign near and inside the ovens placed between the first and the second temenos. He thought that those small objects (5-8cm) which lack any residue, almost new, were drinking cups or votive objects. The comparison to similar material refers to a very common type of incense burner used in temple contexts and in tombs where it was part of a ritual of incensation and libation in the context of 'The Beautiful Feast of the Valley' and Djeme rites. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The studies made on the growth of e-learning indicate that it is fast-paced and will considerably reshape education at large. However, the use of technology in transmitting Egyptological information (hieroglyphs and other content) whether for schools, post-secondary, graduate, postgraduate, training or lay-person interest, is not yet at an advanced stage, and additional work and improvement needs to be done in order to elevate the status of e-learning in Egyptology to an accepted discipline. The aim of this paper is to show that e-learning, as a new tool, can play an important role in the dissemination of Egyptological knowledge production, parallel to that of the traditional classroom setting. Therefore, a main goal of creating our website has been to support teaching, learning, and research of the ancient Egyptian language, and especially for Arabic language users. In addition, the website outlines the essential steps in the development of web-based courses or curricula that use principles of e-learning. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The inclusion of Egyptian soon dissolved the disciplinary boundary with epigraphy, broadened the chronological window, which was eventually set to 800 BC - AD 800, and led to the inclusion of further languages such as Coptic, Aramaic and Arabic. Since 2008 Trismegistos also deals with people. Starting out with Greek papyri, where Trismegistos could build on the Prosopographia Ptolemaica, we distilled over 375,000 Greek, Egyptian and Latin names from some 50,000 documents found in the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri. At the same time, names from Demotic, Hieroglyphic and Hieratic texts were entered manually. The data from Coptic papyrological texts have been added through cooperation with Alain Delattre. Today, Trismegistos has 196,409 attestations of Egyptian names, but especially for Demotic and other Egyptian scripts the coverage is lacunose. Over the past years, the extensive amount of data in Trismegistos People has led to significant breakthroughs in quantitative research, e.g. on theophoric names in the Late Period, double names in Ptolemaic Egypt, and the rise of Christianity in the 4th century AD. Lately, we have been taking things a step further by applying network analysis. We will present some examples here, to illustrate its relevance for the study of religion and society on the basis of names. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The same radio wave and electromagnetic field theory and technology for wireless communication and remote sensing is applied for WPT. In conventional wireless communication systems, information is ""carried"" on a radio wave and is then transmitted over a distance. In WPT however, the energy of the radio wave itself is transmitted over a distance. Wireless communication technology has proven to be extremely useful, however in future it should be even more useful to apply both wireless communication and wireless power technologies together. There are various WPT technologies, e.g. inductive near field WPT, resonance coupling WPT, WPT via radio waves, and laser power transfer. Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves focusses on recent technologies and applications of the WPT via radio waves in far field. The book also covers the history, and future, of WPT via radio waves, as well as safety, EMC and coexistence of radio waves for WPT. Technical topics discussed in the book include: Radio Wave Generation Radio Wave Amplification with Solid States Circuit and Microwave Tubes Antenna and Beam Forming Technologies Radio Wave Conversion/Rectification to Electricity Battery-less Sensor Applications toward Internet of Things (IoT) Solar Power Satellite Application Safety, EMC, Coexistence of Radio Waves for the WPT.

Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeinga better condition of life.

Electrospun nanofibers have emerged recently as potential carrier materials for controlled and sustained drug release. Here, we present a facile method to prevent burst release by tuning the surface wettability through template assisted micropatterning of drug loaded electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) nanofibers. A known amount of drug (Diclofenac sodium) was first mixed with CA and then electrospun in the form of a nanofabric. This as-spun network was hydrophilic in nature. However, when electrospinning was carried out through non-conducting templates, viz nylon meshes with 50 and 100 μm size openings, two kinds of hydrophobic micro-patterned CA nanofabrics were produced. In vitro transdermal testing of our nanofibrous mats was carried out; these tests were able to show that it would be possible to create a patch for transdermal drug release. Further, our results show that with optimized micro-patterned dimensions, a zero order sustained drug release of up to 12 h may be achieved for the transdermal system when compared to non-patterned samples. This patterning caused a change in the surface wettability, to a hydrophobic surface, resulting in a controlled diffusion of the hydrophilic drug. Patterning assisted in controlling the initial burst release, which is a significant finding especially for low half-life drugs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adepu Shivakalyani; Gaydhane Mrunalini K.; Kakunuri Manohar; Sharma Chandra S.; Khandelwal Mudrika; Eichhorn Stephen J.,Department of Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering\Indian Institute of Technology\India; Department of Chemical Engineering\Indian Institute of Technology\India; University of Exeter\Mathematics and Physical Sciences\United Kingdom,-,Diclofenac sodium; Drug release; Electrospinning; Micro-patterning; Nanofibers

In this chapter, the coexistence problem is experimentally discussed, particularly WLAN devices powered by WPT. In general, two schemes exist to divide radio resources: frequency and time divisions. Radio resource management to enable coexistence of WPT and WLAN in the frequency domain is referred to as adjacent channel operation of continuous WPT and WLAN data transmission. That in the time domain is referred to as co-channel operation of intermittent WPT and WLAN data transmission. Experimental results reveal that, even when these operations are implemented, several new problems arise because WLAN devices have been developed without considering the existence of WPT. One problem clarified in our experiment is that adjacent channel operation in a 2.4-GHz band does not necessarily perform well because of the considerable interference. This interference occurs regardless of the frequency separation in a 2.4-GHz band. The other problem is that intermittent WPT may result in throughput degradation because of rate adaptation in WLAN. As one solution to this throughput degradation, an exposure assessment-based rate adaptation scheme is implemented and evaluated. © 2018 River Publishers.

It is found that when CIGS/CdS interface is annealed for a proper duration the corresponding CIGS thin film solar cells show enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) as well as corresponding conversion efficiency. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurement results indicate that the CIGS thin film solar cells exhibit an increase in net defect density (NCV) and long lifetime for the carriers, respectively, after the annealing treatment of CIGS/CdS at a mediate annealing temperature here. Moreover, the net defect density of annealed solar cells at higher annealing temperatures for a long duration is reduced. All the variations in the solar cell performances, NCVand carrier lifetime would be related to the passivation of Se vacancies and InCudefects, surface (interface) states as well as positive interface discharges and Cu migration etc. A high efficiency CIGS solar cell of 14.4% is achieved. The optimized solar cell of 17.2% with a MgF2anti-reflective layer has been obtained.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Institute of Photovoltaics\College of Physics Science and Technology\China; Institute of New Energy Technology\College of Information Science and Technology\China,-,"Annealing; Cu(In,Ga)Se2thin film solar cells; Oxygenation"

Under Ecuadorian law one of the principal ways to protect private lands is to declare them as protected forests and vegetation. These areas for the most part do not receive funding from the government but their designation does provide some legal support when the inevitable conflicts in land use arise. Cerro Blanco, which was designated a protected forest in 1989 via government decree, is one of the earliest and also most consolidated of the protected forests. With support from the private sector, principally Holcim, which has a cement-producing plant in the forest buffer zone, Fundación Pro Bosque has set up a broad-based management program that includes control and vigilance, dry forest restoration, environmental education and interpretation, scientific investigation, and community development. This article provides a perspective of establishing protected areas in biodiverse areas facing many challenges, including rapid urban expansion, poorly regulated land use, and encroachment. The article includes some lessons learned that may be of use in attempting to establish protected areas in other places with similar challenges. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Horstman Eric,Fundación Pro Bosque (Pro Forest Foundation)\Guayaquil\Ecuador,-,-

XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, XPS, UV–vis-DRS and PL spectroscopy were used to characterize the phase structure, morphology, chemical composition, oxidation state, and optical properties of AgBr/Bi2Sn2O7heterojunction. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. The obtained AgBr/Bi2Sn2O7composite with the 1:1 molar ratio exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Further first-principles calculations indicated that the hybridization interaction between Ag and O atoms at AgBr/Bi2Sn2O7interface is expected to be beneficial for enhancing the charge transfer and improving the photocatalytic activity of heterostructured composites.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hu Chaohao; Zhuang Jing; Zhong Liansheng; Zhong Yan; Wang Dianhui; Zhou Huaiying,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Guilin University of Electronic Technology\China; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Information Materials\Guilin University of Electronic Technology\China,-,Bi2Sn2O7; Chemical precipitation method; First-principles calculations; Heterostructure; Photocatalytic activity

628.html,Discrete multitone for Metro Datacenter Interconnect,"For the Metro Datacenter Interconnects, the intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) offers the advantages of low cost and low complexity. In this chapter, we will review an important IM/DD scheme, discrete multitone (DMT). After the introduction of DMT's application scenarios and history, the conventional operational principle of DMT will be illustrated in detail. Then, we will review some advanced DMT architectures for Metro DCI applications which can overcome the dispersion and interference challenges by employing some advanced modulators. Single sideband (SSB) DMT is very simple, while chromatic dispersion (CD) calculation and precompensation are not necessary. Electrical dispersion compensation (EDC) double sideband (DSB) DMT owns 3-dB better performance than the SSBDMT. Twin-SSB-DMT has the highest spectral efficiency (SE). Furthermore, a spectrally efficient signal to signal beating interference (SSBI) cancellation system based on the guard-band twin-SSB-DMT will be demonstrated. These schemes make DMT capable of tens of kilometers of transmission and suitable for Metro DCI applications. © 2018 River Publishers.",Liu Gordon Ning; Zuo Tianjian; Zhang Liang,Huawei Technologies Co.

Such amplifiers are used to extract and condition microto millivolt scale signals aroused from weak neural activities. As such, they typically have ultra-low noise level as they usually dominate the noise level of front-end sensing blocks. Further, miniaturized neural amplifiers based on integrated circuits offer benefits of small form factors and ultra-low power consumption, allowing unobtrusive operations and minimum tissue heat dissipation. They are, hence, gaining popularity rapidly for wearable and implant applications.

This WPT method is insensitive to the exact location of the receiver (Rx) as a design example for energizing such distributed implantable neural interfaces, which are found to be causing less damage to the surrounding neural tissue and lasting longer. The presented structure utilizes a high-Q resonator on the target wirelessly powered plane that encompasses multiple randomly positioned FFIs, all powered by a large external transmitter (Tx). Based on resonant WPT fundamentals, we have devised a detailed method for analysis, optimization of the FFIs, and explored design strategies including safety concerns, coil segmentation, and specific absorption rate (SAR) limits while using realistic finite element simulation models in HFSS with head tissue layers. We have built several FFI prototypes based on the optimization procedure to characterize their performance in vitro. Additionally, we provide a simple but accurate method for power transfer efficiency and power delivered to the load measurements with desired source and load resistances, which are matched with actual conditions that may be smaller or larger than 50 Ω utilizing a network analyzer (NA) and a spectrum analyzer (SA) with 50 Ω ports. © 2018 River Publishers.",Mirbozorgi S.

Such responses are derived from analysis of patient signals made available thanks to advances in sensing and instrumentation technologies. However, given the complexity of the underlying physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, analysis of these signals is challenging on many levels. Data-driven methods for analysis are showing substantial promise towards these challenges, actuated both by the large-scale emergence of data in the medical domain and by progress in algorithms from the machine-learning and statistical-signal-processing domains. This chapter explores the platformlevel challenges with extending data-driven methods to resource-constrained (energy, area) wearable and implantable devices.

This case study introduces students to the institutional complexities and ecological vulnerabilities that slowed and confounded response to the disaster due to an unclear chain of responsibility across sectors. This case study also assesses how West Virginia residents and agencies perceived the environmental risk and the responsibility of different institutional agencies and how these perceptions added to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding response to the spill.

639.html,Watershed protection to secure ecosystem services: The New York city watershed governance arrangement,"In 1997, New York City and a group of smaller municipalities in the Catskills region of New York came to agree upon a novel and complex means of protecting water quality in the City's upstate reservoirs. The Memorandum of Agreement they authored tied previously uncooperating governments to a new shared goal: preserve the ecological integrity of the Catskill and Delaware watersheds so that the City could avoid chemically filtering its municipal water. The agreement represents a policy experiment in reaction to a stark choice. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1986 Surface Water Treatment Rule mandated that the City either filter its surface water supply or maintain a watershed control program to ensure the long-term protection of water quality in its source watersheds. The City decided to pursue a watershed control program in lieu of the more expensive filtration. The choice has led to a governing arrangement that has theoretical implications for how to simultaneously secure ecosystem services, promote rural livelihoods, and produce the critical public good of potable water to millions of people. The policy solution displays how cooperative institutions may provide low-cost and low-tech solutions to environmental dilemmas to protect ecosystem services. However, over time, governing entities have faced challenges that raise questions about the durability of the arrangement. This case study explores those challenges to better elucidate the possibilities and pitfalls of watershed governance to secure ecosystem services. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Hanlon Jeffrey W.,Northern Arizona University\Flagstaff\United States,-,-
64.html,"Co-digestion of rice straw and cow dung to supply cooking fuel and fertilizers in rural India: Impact on human health, resource flows and climate change","Anaerobic digestion of cow dung with new feedstock such as crop residues to increase the biogas potential is an option to help overcoming several issues faced by India. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas that can replace biomass cooking fuels and reduce indoor air pollution. It also provides digestate, a fertilizer that can contribute to compensate nutrient shortage on agricultural land. Moreover, it avoids the burning of rice straw in the fields which contributes to air pollution in India and climate change globally. Not only the technical and economical feasibility but also the environmental sustainability of such systems needs to be assessed. The potential effects of implementing community digesters co-digesting cow dung and rice straw on carbon and nutrients flows, human health, resource efficiency and climate change are analyzed by conducting a Substance Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment. The implementation of the technology is considered at the level of the state of Chhattisgarh. Implementing this scenario reduces the dependency of the rural community to nitrogen and phosphorus from synthetic fertilizers only by 0.1 and 1.6%, respectively, but the dependency of farmers to potassium from synthetic fertilizers by 31%. The prospective scenario returns more organic carbon to agricultural land and thus has a potential positive effect on soil quality. The implementation of the prospective scenario can reduce the health impact of the local population by 48%, increase the resource efficiency of the system by 60% and lower the impact on climate change by 13%. This study highlights the large potential of anaerobic digestion to overcome the aforementioned issues faced by India. It demonstrates the need to couple local and global assessments and to conduct analyses at the substance level to assess the sustainability of such systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sfez Sophie; De Meester Steven; Dewulf Jo,Department of Sustainable Organic Chemistry and Technology (EnVOC)\Faculty of Bioscience Engineering\Belgium; Department of Industrial Biological Sciences\Laboratory of Industrial Water and Ecotechnology (LIWET)\Belgium,-,Agricultural waste; Biogas; Life Cycle Assessment; Nutrients; Substance Flow Analysis
641.html,Medical re-enactments: Ancient Egyptian prescriptions from an emic viewpoint,"In the past, Ancient Egyptian medicinal prescriptions have been the focus of research by scientists from a variety of disciplines, especially Egyptologists, historians of science, physicians, biologists, and pharmacists. Their work considers, in most cases, today's natural scientific perspective, namely the question whether a remedy may have had an effect in a 'modern' sense. Some of the lexicographical works concerning drug or symptom names, are based on such a correlation, proposing a drug or disease name for an untranslatable word in a prescription by evaluating the indications and looking for effective drugs, which could have been available in Ancient Egypt. This paper points in the opposite direction. The aim is to introduce new methodological tools to gain an emic, namely an insider's, perspective on medicinal prescriptions, by applying an experimental-archaeological perspective and by focussing on manufacturing processes, its terminology and its interrelations with ingredients, symptoms and patients. The paper starts with a pharmacological and philological examination of a prescription against worms, questioning its conventional translation. Afterwards, the new approach is introduced. With the help of three concrete recipe examples, semantic and process-oriented readings of prescription texts as medical re-enactments of symptoms and healing processes will be demonstrated. As a result, we will achieve conceptual structures in order to recover features of previously philologically undetermined drugs and symptoms, and new perspectives that will help to broaden our knowledge of the concepts of Ancient Egyptian 'physiology' and 'pathophysiology'. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

642.html,The Akh-menu of Thutmosis III at Karnak. The Sokarian Rooms,"The epigraphic survey and study of the Sokarian Rooms reliefs and inscriptions described in this contribution are part of a project, which includes a photographic survey and publication of facsimiles, covering this whole self-contained area built by Thutmosis III in the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak. This four-angled architectural space, accessible by a single door from the columned and pillared hall called heret-ib, was interpreted as a cult centre devoted to the god Sokar. Many representations of the henu-bark, emblem of Sokar, appear on the walls of the eight-columned hall (SK.Sh) and on loose blocks probably coming from this court and the chapels built in the southern part (SK.1 to SK.3). In the inscriptions, the divinity is called 'Sokar, the great god, master of the shetyť, a name for the cabin of the henu-bark, where all the parts of the body of Osiris were gathered in order to reconstitute the physical integrity of the god. This compound could be connected with the Osirian rites, because Sokar is always associated with the cult of Osiris during the New Kingdom (Sokar can take on the appearance of this god in this period) and to its rites of rebirth. The king, identified with the god Sokar, performs the funerary rites of the tent of purification and of the opening of the mouth. As revealed in many Theban temples, a compound was dedicated to Ra (with a solar altar in the north-east), and here in the Akh-menu, a set of rooms devoted to the composite form (Ptah-)Sokar-Osiris. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

643.html,'To build a temple in the beautiful white stone ofAnu'. The use of Tura limestone in Theban architecture,"Tura limestone, exploited 15km south of present-day Cairo, has been extensively used in the architecture of the Old Kingdom, notably for the casing of pyramids and visible parts of temples. By contrast, other parts of contemporary monuments were built in local limestone, exploited in quarries close to the construction sites. Tura limestone is regarded as a 'prestige' material, most probably because its fine-grained texture allowed the execution of finely detailed reliefs, and gave the building a plain white, shining appearance. A similar stone procurement/use pattern prevailed at Thebes in the 11th Dynasty, with building stone (sandstone) and fine-grained limestone coming from a nearby upstream quarry (Dababiya), used in visible parts of the monuments. Northern Tura limestone makes its first appearance in Thebes in the reign of Amenemhat I. The chronology of the monuments of this king in the Theban area is unfortunately poorly constrained, but the use of Tura limestone blocks is evidenced at all sites where the king built (or rebuilt) temples: Tod, Armant, Dendera and Coptos, together with Dababiya limestone. Later on, Senwosret I predominantly used Tura limestone at Karnak. The specificity of Amenemhat I is that the king used both stones, from Dababiya and Tura. The reason why he did so is questioned in this paper. Constraints arising from procurement or contrasted geotechnical behaviour are ruled out, as the Dababiya quarry was to provide massive quantities of stone until the mid 18th Dynasty, and Tura and Dababiya limestones are both used for Amenemhat's monuments, in a wholly similar way, with strongly oversized blocks. It rather seems that the introduction of Tura limestone in Theban architecture results from a mix of political and religious reasons. Politically, the use of Tura limestone helped anchor the new dynasty, just founded by Amenemhat I, in the continuity of the great rulers and builders of the Old Kingdom, and helped create, through the achievement of an ambitious architectural programme, a strong architectural link between the north and south, representing the union of the two lands. In the religious sphere, too, there was an obvious 'mirror effect' between northern and southern Heliopolis. This parallelism was, in a typically Egyptian way, materialized by the use of a same 'prestige' stone at both locations. As this was unlikely to be noticed at first glance, the kings took care to state that they used Tura limestone in explicit texts carved on Theban monuments. If in the Middle Kingdom there is an agreement between texts and the material used then this is no longer true in the New Kingdom. However, it remains important to state that the temple is built in the 'beautiful white stone of Anu', even though the stone comes from a nearby quarry. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

645.html,Thermoelectric power plant for compensation of hydrological cycle change: Environmental impacts in Brazil,"Brazil has abundant water resources and depends on them for hydroelectric power generation. In 2011, 81.9% of the electricity in the country was produced by hydropower. A significant change in the Brazilian hydrological cycle reduced this percentage to 64% in 2015. The scarcity of rain decreased the volumes in the reservoirs of the hydroelectric power plants located mainly in the Southeast, Center-West and Northeast regions. In this scenario, the National Operator System authorized the use in full load of thermoelectric plants powered by natural gas, biomass and coal. As a result, thermoelectric generation grew 329%, increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The intensification in the use of thermoelectric energy leads to a vicious energy-environment cycle, as it increases the CO2 emissions. Brazilian government is aware of the necessity of electricity generation, and future uncertainties generated by the instabilities of hydrological cycles may jeopardize the country's energy security. The country has proposed programs to encourage energy generation by other renewable sources (wind and solar) and avoid the use of thermoelectric plants, which increase the generation costs and environmental impacts. This could compromise the goals of reducing carbon emissions signed by Brazil at Paris Conference (COP21). © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Rosa Mendes Luiz Fernando; Sthel Marcelo Silva,Coordenation of Environmental Engineering\Federal Fluminense Institute of Education\Brazil; Center of Science and Technology\North Fluminense State University\Brazil,-,-
646.html,Intracellular Delivery of β-Galactosidase Enzyme Using Arginase-Responsive Dextran Sulfate/Poly- l -arginine Capsule for Lysosomal Storage Disorder,"β-Galactosidase (β-gal) is one of the important lysosomal enzymes that is involved in the breakdown of glycosphingolipids (e.g., GM1 ganglioside), and its deficiency leads to GM1 Gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Intracellular delivery of β-gal is one of the preferable methods to treat this kind of LSDs. However, it cannot permeate the cell membrane due to its intricate macromolecular nature, low stability, and degradation by endogenous proteases. To this end, we report efficient intracellular delivery of β-gal via arginase-responsive dextran sulfate/poly-l-arginine polymer capsules (DS/PA capsules). The therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme has been assessed in two gene-deficient diseased cell lines, SV (β-galactosidase gene-deficient mouse fibroblast) and R201C (deficient human β-galactosidase gene-introduced mouse fibroblast), and in wild-type mouse fibroblast immortalized cell lines. The activity of β-gal enzyme has been estimated within cells by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-cholera toxin B as a florescent probe that illustrates the level of GM1 ganglioside, the β-gal substrate. We found 1.8-, 3.4-, and 2.8-fold reduction in the substrate level in R201C, SV, and wild-type mouse fibroblast, respectively, which confirms the release and therapeutic activity of β-gal enzyme inside the cells. Moreover, enzyme delivery in gene-deficient diseased cell lines (SV and R201C) via DS/PA capsules reduced the level of enzyme substrate to a normal endogenous level, which is present in untreated wild-type mouse fibroblast cells. We note that loading of β-gal enzyme within DS/PA capsules was estimated to be 3 mU per hundred capsules and more than 77% of β-gal is released within 12 h. Overall, these results highlight the potential of DS/PA capsules as an efficient delivery carrier for therapeutic enzyme. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Gupta Meenakshi; Pandey Himanshu; Sivakumar Sri,Institute of Pharmacy\Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University\India; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences\Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture\India; Department of Chemical Engineering\Material Science Programme\India,-,-

Here, the two diblock copolymers 1 and 2, of which compositions are 0.5 - x and 0.5 + x (0 < x < 0.5), respectively, were blended, and the morphology diagram was constructed in the plot of χZ vs the average composition of the A component, where χ is the interaction parameter between A and B segments and Z is the average degree of polymerization of the two AB diblock copolymers. The temperature-dependent morphologies were analyzed by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. It was found that the morphology diagram agrees in principle with the theoretical one for the neat AB diblocks by Matsen and Bates (Macromolecules 1996, 29, 1091-1098), although the disordered phase was a bit expanded in the experimentally determined morphology diagram. Anomalous temperature dependencies in the lamellar spacing have been also comprehensively studied for the binary blends of antisymmetric diblock copolymers as a function of the degree of compositional asymmetry by closely adjusting the average composition in the blend specimen at 0.50. For this purpose, more than 20 neat diblock copolymers have been synthesized with a wide range of compositions from 0.20 to 0.87 and a range of molecular weight of 12000-33800. The temperature dependencies of the lamellar spacing were also analyzed by synchrotron SAXS measurements. As a result, the following things were found. The scaling exponent α in D ∼ Tαwas still negative but slightly larger than the usual value (i.e., α = -0.33) for the smaller degree of asymmetry in the composition (i.e., x is small), while α became positive for the higher degree of asymmetry. The latter result is very anomalous because the temperature dependence is opposite (i.e., the lamellar spacing increases with an increase of temperature). The value of α was found to be linearly rationalized with the degree of asymmetry τ (which is especially introduced in the current paper for this purpose), for the binary blends with the average composition of 0.50. Based on this result, one can prepare lamellar microdomains, of which spacing does not change with temperature, by blending two diblock copolymers with τ = 1.33 (corresponding to 0.3 and 0.7 of compositions) having similar molecular weights. This would be important for manufacturing materials with properties (for instance, the optical property) independent of temperature. From the current study, the binary blends of the antisymmetric diblock copolymers are concluded to be versatile such that the precise controls of the morphologies and the temperature dependencies of the lamellar microdomains are plausible. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Fukuhara Junji; Yasui Akifumi; Yamamoto Katsuhiro; Sakurai Shinichi,Department of Biobased Materials Science\Kyoto Institute of Technology\Japan; Department of Life Science and Applied Chemistry\Graduate School of Engineering\Japan; Frontier Research Institute for Materials Science\Nagoya Institute of Technology\Japan; Institute of Chemical Research\Kyoto University\Japan,-,-
648.html,Electricity on Rubber Surfaces: A New Energy Conversion Effect,"This work describes the conversion of mechanical energy to electricity, by periodically stretching rubber tubing and allowing it to relax. The rubber surface shows periodic and reversible electrostatic potential variations, in phase with the tubing length. The potential change depends on the elastomer used: silicone loses charge when stretched and becomes strongly negative when relaxed, whereas the stretched natural rubber is positive, becoming negative when relaxed. Every other elastomeric material that was tested also showed periodic potential but followed different patterns. When the motion stops, the potential on the resting samples decreases quickly to zero. The potential oscillation amplitude decreases when the relative humidity decreases from 65 to 27%, but it is negligible when the rubber tubing is previously swollen with water or paraffin oil. Elastomer charging patterns do not present the well-known characteristics of piezo-, flexo-, or triboelectricity, and they are discussed considering rubber rheology, wear, and surface properties, including the possibility of surface piezoelectricity. The following mechanism is suggested: rubber stretching provokes chemical and morphology changes in its surface, followed by a change in the surface concentration of H+and OH-ions adsorbed along with water. The possibility of the occurrence of similar variations in other systems (both inert and biological) is discussed, together with its implications for energy scavenging from the environment. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Burgo Thiago A.

649.html,Sensing Cellular Metabolic Activity via a Molecular-Controlled Semiconductor Resistor,"Over the last decade, we have developed a molecular-controlled semiconductor resistor (MOCSER) device that is highly sensitive to variations in its surface potentials. This device was applied as a molecular sensor both in the gas phase and in solutions. The device is based on an AlGaAs/GaAs structure. In the current work, we developed an electronic biosensor for real-time, label-free monitoring of cellular metabolic activity by culturing HeLa cells directly on top of the device's conductive channel. Several properties of GaAs make it attractive for developing biosensors, among others its high electron mobility and ability to control the device's properties by proper epitaxial growing. However, GaAs is very reactive and sensitive to oxidation in aqueous solutions, and its arsenic residues are highly toxic. Nevertheless, we have managed to overcome this inherent chemical instability by developing a surface-protecting layer using polymerized (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS). To improve cell adhesion and biocompatibility, the MPTMS-coated devices were further modified with an additional layer of (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS). HeLa cells were found to grow successfully on these devices, and MOCSER devices cultured with these cells were stable and sensitive to cellular metabolic activity. The sensitivity of the MOCSER device results from the sensing of extracellular acidification in the microenvironment of the cell-MOCSER interspace. We have found that this sensitivity is maintained only when the device is partially covered with the cellular layer, whereas at full coverage the sensitivity is lost. This phenomenon is related to the negatively charged cellular membrane potentials that lead to a reduction in the channel's conductivity. We propose that the coated MOCSER device can be applied for real-time and continuous monitoring of cellular viability and activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Kolker Baravik Ilina; Capua Eyal; Ainbinder Elena; Naaman Ron,Department of Chemical and Biological Physics\Weizmann Institute of Science\Israel; Department of Life Sciences Core Facilities\Weizmann Institute of Science\Israel,-,-

650.html,Probing Stress-Induced Optical Birefringence of Glassy Polymers by Whispering Gallery Modes Light Localization,"An optical resonance method for the determination of the strain- and stress-optical coefficients of optically transparent polymers is presented and exemplified for monodisperse and bidisperse molecular weight polystyrene (PS). This method employs whispering gallery modes (WGMs) resonation inside a spheroid polymeric cavity, suspended on an optical fiber taper waist, which, in turn, is used for subjecting the polymeric resonator to controlled strain conditions. The wavelength shifts of equal order transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization WGMs are measured, as well as their relative birefringence versus applied strain. For monodisperse PS microspheroids (2 and 50 kDa) the stress-optical coefficient is negative, contrary to the results for bulk PS in the glassy state indicating different phenyl group orientation of the PS monomer with respect to the strain direction. In the bidisperse (2 and 50 kDa) spheroid with a symmetric monomer composition, local structural irregularities are probably responsible for the observed coupling between WGMs. The method possesses metrological capabilities for probing the molecular orientation of polymer-based resonators. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Milenko Karolina; Pissadakis Stavros; Gkantzounis Georgios; Aluculesei Alina; Fytas George,Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)\Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL)\Greece; Department of Materials Science\University of Crete\Greece; Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research\Ackermannweg 10\Germany; Department of Physics\Advanced Technology Institute\United Kingdom,-,-
651.html,High-Yield Production of Fatty Nitriles by One-Step Vapor-Phase Thermocatalysis of Triglycerides,"Fatty nitriles are widely used as intermediate molecules in the pharmaceutical and polymer industries. In addition, hydrogenation of fatty nitriles produces fatty amines that are common surfactants. In the conventional fatty nitrile process, triglycerides are first hydrolyzed and the resulting fatty acids are catalytically reacted with NH3in a liquid-phase reaction. In this study, we report a simpler one-step fatty nitrile production method that involves a direct vapor-phase reaction of triglycerides with NH3in the presence of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. The reactions were performed in a tubular reactor maintained at 400 °C into which triglycerides were injected through an atomizer to allow rapid volatilization and reaction; NH3was fed as a gas. Several metal oxide catalysts were tested, and reactions in the presence of V2O5resulted in near-theoretical fatty nitrile yields (84 wt % relative to the feed mass). In general, catalysts with higher acidity such as V2O5, Fe2O3, and ZnO showed higher fatty nitrile yields compared to low acidity catalysts such as ZrO, Al2O3, and CuO. Energy balance calculations indicate that the one-step reaction described here would require significantly lower energy than the conventional process primarily because of the elimination of the energy-intense triglyceride hydrolysis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Shirazi Yaser; Tafazolian Hosein; Viamajala Sridhar; Varanasi Sasidhar; Song Zhaoning; Heben Michael J.,Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering\University of Toledo\United States; Department of Physics and Astronomy\University of Toledo\United States; Department of Chemistry\University of California Riverside\United States; Department of Chemical Engineering\Manhattan College\United States,-,-
652.html,Charge-Driven Interaction of Antimicrobial Peptide NK-2 with Phospholipid Membranes,"NK-2, derived from a cationic core region of NK-lysin, displays antimicrobial activity toward negatively charged bacterial membranes. We have studied the interaction of NK-2 with various phospholipid membranes, using a variety of experimental techniques, such as, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), potential, and dynamic light scattering. As bacteria mimicking membranes, we have chosen large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of negatively charged phospholipid and neutral phospholipids. ITC and potential results show the stronger binding affinity of NK-2 to negatively charged membranes than to neutral membranes. Saturation of the isotherm, obtained from ITC, at a given lipid to NK-2 ratio, was found to be consistent with the charge compensation, determined from potential. A surface partition model with electrostatic contribution was used to estimate the intrinsic binding constant and other thermodynamical parameters of binding kinetics of NK-2. The size distribution of negatively charged LUV in the presence of NK-2 was found to increase drastically, indicating the presence of large aggregates. Such a large aggregate has not been observed in neutral membranes, which supports the ITC and potential results. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Karmakar Sanat; Maity Pabitra; Halder Animesh,Department of Physics\Soft Matter and Biophysics Laboratory\India,-,-
653.html,Drug-Triggered Self-Assembly of Linear Polymer into Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Delivery of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Drugs in Breast Cancer Cells,"Breast cancer is the most devastating disease among females globally. Conventional chemotherapeutic regimen relies on the use of highly cytotoxic drugs as monotherapy and combination therapy leading to severe side effects to the patients as collateral damage. Moreover, combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs create erratic biodistribution and suboptimal medicinal outcome. Hence, packaging multiple drugs of diverse mechanisms of action and biodistribution for safe delivery into tumor tissues with optimal dosages is indispensable for next-generation breast cancer therapy. To address these, in this report, we describe a unique cisplatin-triggered self-assembly of linear polymer into 3D-spherical sub 200 nm particles. These nanoparticles comprise a hydrophobic (paclitaxel) and hydrophilic drug (cisplatin) simultaneously in a single particle. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed hydrophilic-hydrophilic interaction and interchain H-bonding as underlying mechanisms of self-assembly. Confocal microscopy studies evidently demonstrated that these novel nanoparticles can home into lysosomes in breast cancer cells, fragment subcellular nuclei, and prevent cell division, leading to improved breast cancer cell death compared to free drug combination. Moreover, 3D-breast tumor spheroids were reduced remarkably by the treatment of these nanoparticles within 24 h. These dual-drug-loaded self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles have prospective to be translated into a clinical strategy for breast cancer patients. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Palvai Sandeep; Anandi Libi; Sarkar Sujit; Augustus Meera; Roy Sudip; Lahiri Mayurika; Basu Sudipta,Department of Chemistry\Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)-Pune\India; Department of Biology\Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)-Pune\India; CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory\Dr. Homi Bhabha Road\India,-,-

655.html,Resolution of Racemic Mixtures by Phase Transition of PEGylated Resolving Agents,"A novel, efficient, and simple method for the resolution of racemic mixtures is presented in which PEGylated resolving agents are subjected to diastereomeric complex formation in alcohols. The resulting complexes then undergo temperature-assisted phase transition, affording a precipitate that is enriched in one enantiomer and separable by filtration. In an aqueous solution, phase transition can be caused by the methods used in the precipitation of poly(ethylene glycol) (e.g., addition of ammonium sulfate). A number of racemic amines have been successfully resolved using this method. The first cycle of resolution affords the amines with an optical purity of 72-85% from their corresponding racemic mixture in good yields (78-90%). An additional cycle improved the optical purity to 87-95%. The PEGylated resolving agents can be recovered and reutilized without the loss of resolution efficiency. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Mokhtari Javad; Azarnoosh Sahar; Karimian Khashayar,Arasto Pharmaceutical Chemicals Inc.\Yousefabad\Iran; Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics\University of Tehran\Iran; Departments of Chemistry\Science and Research Branch\Iran,-,-

657.html,"Structure, Stability, and Kinetics of Vacancy Defects in Monolayer PtSe2: A First-Principles Study","The recent epitaxial growth of monolayer PtSe2has raised hope for its novel applications in valleytronic, spintronic, and energy-harvesting devices. Compared with 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides, the 1T-phase PtSe2is much less studied and this is especially true for its defects behaviors and their influence on electronic properties. In this article, we systemically explore the structure, stability, and kinetics of both Pt and Se vacancies in monolayer PtSe2using first-principles calculations. By examining the relative energies of these vacancies, we identify the most stable Se/Pt single and double vacancies. In particular, we reveal a new type of Se double vacancy structure with the lowest energy. Energetically, both Se and Pt single vacancies prefer to combine to form double vacancies. All Se and Pt vacancies have remarkable influence on the electronic properties. Moreover, Pt single and double vacancies can introduce strong spin polarization in PtSe2, which may be promising for spintronic applications. These findings not only enrich the fundamental understanding of 1T-phase PtSe2but also provide useful guidance to design PtSe2for its optoelectronic and spintronic applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Gao Junfeng; Cheng Yuan; Tian Tian; Hu Xiaoling; Zeng Kaiyang; Zhang Gang; Zhang Yong-Wei,Institute of High Performance Computing\ASTAR\Singapore; School of Natural and Applied Science\Key Laboratory of Space Applied Physics and Chemistry\China; Department of Mechanical Engineering\National University of Singapore\Singapore,-,-
658.html,Proposed Cesium-free Mineralization Method for Soil Decontamination: Demonstration of Cesium Removal from Weathered Biotite,"The removal possibility of sorbed Cs from weathered biotite (WB), which is considered a major Cs adsorbent in the soil of Fukushima, has been investigated by the addition of an NaCl-CaCl2mixed salt powder with a 1:1 ratio of Na and Ca and subsequent heat treatment under a reduced pressure of 14 Pa. X-ray fluorescence analysis was used to determine the Cs removal rate at elevated temperatures. The structural changes and new phases formed were determined using powder X-ray diffraction as well as electron diffraction and X-ray microanalysis in a transmission electron microscope. We found that Cs was completely removed from the specimen heated at 700 °C, where WB completely decomposed and augite was formed. On the basis of this finding, we propose the Cs-free mineralization method as a new soil-decontamination process in which Cs minerals are transformed by heating with certain additives into minerals that cannot incorporate Cs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Honda Mitsunori; Shimoyama Iwao; Kogure Toshihiro; Baba Yuji; Suzuki Shinichi; Yaita Tsuyoshi,Materials Sciences Research Center (MSRC)\Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)\Japan; Fukushima Environmental Safety Center\Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)\Japan; Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences\Graduate School of Science\Japan,-,-

These predictions were validated with experimental data from the literature and experimental data from the oxidation of biomass to formic acid process measured in this work. Extraction solvents discussed in this work are 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, ethyl n-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, benzyl formate, and heptyl formate. The considered temperature ranged from 273 to 363 K under atmospheric pressure. Perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) was used for prediction purposes applying an approach as simple as possible and as complex as necessary to achieve trustworthy data for selecting the best extraction solvent. Using PC-SAFT allowed identifying 1-hexanol as the most promising solvent out of the 11 extraction agents. The predicted data were in good agreement with the experimental distribution coefficients and the selectivities, which are very sensitive to experimental uncertainties. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Veith Heiner; Voges Matthias; Held Christoph; Albert Jakob,Laboratory of Thermodynamics\Technische Universität Dortmund\Germany; Lehrstuhl für Chemische Reaktionstechnik\Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg\Germany,-,-
66.html,Landscape determinants of spatio-temporal patterns of aerosol optical depth in the two most polluted metropolitans in the United States,"Elevated concentration of atmospheric aerosols during severe urban air pollution episodes necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying determinants for a sustainable urban environment. The 15-year (2001–2015) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data for the Phoenix and Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas were applied to examine the spatio-temporal patterns and dynamics of urban aerosols. The strongly correlated temporal trends of AOD were observed due to the similar seasonal pattern of aerosol emissions and potential synoptic connections between two areas. Relatively higher mean value and lower decreasing trend of AOD were found in the PMA. Correlations reveal that topography is the predominant factor affecting the spatial pattern of AOD, as compared to the urban land use and vegetation. The effect of urbanization on air pollution varies with preexisting landscape, which apparently alleviates aerosol concentration in the PMA. Vegetation mitigates air pollution despite its emission of fine mode aerosols. As a cross-validation, the ground-measured concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5and PM10) were compared against AOD. The abnormal weak positive or strong negative AOD–PM2.5associations result from the relatively small portion of anthropogenic aerosols and the changing atmospheric boundary layer height. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Chenghao; Wang Chuyuan; Myint Soe W.; Wang Zhi-Hua,School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment\Arizona State University\United States; School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning\Arizona State University\United States,-,Aerosol optical depth; AOD–PM association; Land use; Topography; Urban environment; Vegetation

665.html,Structural Features and Ligand Selectivity for 10 Intermediates in the Activation Process of β2-Adrenergic Receptor,"It has already been suggested by researchers that there should be multiple intermediate states in the activation process for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the intermediate states are very short-lived and hardly captured by the experiments, leading to very limited understanding of their structural features and drug efficacies. In this work, a novel joint strategy of targeted molecular dynamics simulation, conventional molecular dynamics simulation, and virtual screening is developed to address the problems. The results from 10 intermediate conformations obtained from the work reveal that the ligand pocket is very unstable and fluctuates between the inactive state and the active one in the case of ligand-free, in particular for ECL2 as a gate-keeper of the ligand-binding. The ligand-binding site could be stable in the active state with a small volume and a completely closed ECL2, only when the G-protein-binding region is fully activated. In addition, the activations of the ligand-binding pocket and G-protein-binding site are relatively independent and exhibit a loose allosteric coupling, which contributes to the existence of multiple intermediate conformations. Interestingly, the screening performance of the agonists does not increase on increasing the overall activity of the intermediate state, but is dependent on the activated extent of the ligand pocket. The receptor is prone to bind the agonist when closing ECL2 and reducing the ligand-binding pocket volume, whereas it is more favorable for binding the antagonist when opening ECL2 and increasing the pocket volume. These observations added to previous studies could help us better understand the activation mechanism of GPCRs and provide valuable information for drug design. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Liang Tao; Yuan Yuan; Wang Ran; Guo Yanzhi; Li Menglong; Pu Xuemei; Li Chuan,College of Chemistry\Sichuan University\China; College of Computer Science\Sichuan University\China; College of Management\Southwest University for Nationalities\China,-,-

669.html,"Etiology of hand, foot and mouth disease and genetic characteristics of prevalent enteroviruses in Qingdao in 2015","Objective: To investigate the etiology of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and to analyze the genetic characteristics of three prevalent enteroviruses in Qingdao in 2015. Methods: Citywide surveillance data in 2015 were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD in Qingdao. RNA samples extracted from throat swab of HFMD cases were examined for general enteroviruses (EVs) such as enterovirus 71(EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and CA6 by real-time RT-PCR. Full-length VP1 genes of EV-positive specimens were amplified and sequenced. Sequencing results were phylogenetically analyzed using MEGA 7.0 software package. Results: A total of 804 patients with HFMD were identified from 1 176 patients in 2015. CA6 (41.4%), EV71 (31.6%) and CA16 (15.3%) were the predominant EVs causing HFMD. Children 5 years of age and under accounted for 80.3% of the 804 HFMD cases. CA6 was responsible for 48.9% of HFMD cases in children under 3 years old. The epidemic subtypes of EV71 and CA16 in Qingdao were C4a and B1b, respectively. Twenty-eight randomly selected CA6 strains were all classified into type A genome. Conclusion: CA6, EV71 and CA16 were the prevalent pathogens causing HFMD in Qingdao in 2015. CA6 became the most predominant pathogen, mainly targeting children under 3 years old. C4a remained the prevailing subtype of EV71, while different from the co-prevalence of B1a and B1b subtypes in the past, B1b became the predominant subtype of CA16. CA6 strains circulating in Qingdao in 2015 mainly belonged to type A genome and evolved into multiple smaller branches. However, CA6 strains isolated in Qingdao in 2015 and 2013 located in different branches.

The heat treatment effects on the organic molecules and crystalline structure were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was observed that oleylamine (OLA) adsorbed onto the CIGS surface was difficult to remove during sintering. Ligand-exchange with m-xylene or 1-hexanethiol can promote the removal of oleylamine adsorbed onto the CIGS surface and prevent the residual carbon from forming during sintering, which leads to grain growth and densification. A dense CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2can be obtained using the precursor powders after ligand-exchange with 1-hexanethiol and m-xylene to remove organic molecules and sintering at 600 °C for 2 h under Se atmosphere.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Yang Chang-Ting; Hsiang Hsing-I,Department of Resources Engineering\National Cheng Kung University\Taiwan,-,1-Hexanethiol; CIGS; Heat treatment; Ligand exchange; m-Xylene

Methods: Thirty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups (n=10): control group, myocarditis group and AKT activator-treated group. Those in the latter two groups were intraperitoneally injected with CVB3 to establish the mouse model of acute viral myocarditis. Daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.04 mg/g of Akt activator (SC79) was given to each mouse in the AKT activator-treated group 24 hours after CVB3 infection for 7 consecutive days, while the mice in the other two groups were given the same dose of normal saline. HE staining was used to observe the infiltration of inflammatory cells and tissue necrosis. Expression of CVB3 and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 in cardiac tissues at mRNA level was detected by q-PCR. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured by ELISA to evaluate myocardial injury. Changes in the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3 and Beclin1 at protein level as well as PI3K/AKT2/mTOR pathway were analyzed by Western blot assay. Results: Compared with the control group, massive inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in cardiac specimens of mice with myocarditis, but no obvious tissue necrosis was detected. Moreover, expression of CVB3 and inflammatory factors in cardiac tissues at mRNA level, levels of BNP and cTnI in blood, LC3Ⅱ to LC3Ⅰratio as well as Beclin1 protein level in cardiac tissues were significantly increased after CVB3 infection (P<0.05), whereas the activity of PI3K/AKT2/mTOR signaling pathway was decreased. AKT activator not only down-regulated the LC3Ⅱ to LC3Ⅰratio and the expression of Beclin1 protein, but also enhanced the activation of PI3K/AKT2/mTOR signaling pathway in cardiac tissues of mice with myocarditis (P<0.05). Conclusion: Enhanced autophagy and suppressed PI3K/AKT2/mTOR signaling pathway are observed in cardiac tissues of mice with myocarditis, indicating that the activation of autophagy may be regulated by PI3K/AKT2/mTOR signaling pathway.

Methods: Genome of the Streptococcus suis type 2 05ZYH33 strain was extracted and used as a template to amplify SSU05_0946 upstream and downstream homeodomains. Chloramphenicol-resistance gene was amplified by using pSET1 plasmid as the template. These three amplified fragments were fused and integrated with the thermo-sensitive plasmid pSET4s by using overlap extension PCR. Homologous recombination method was used to construct the mutant strain 05ZYH33Δ0946. Differences between the mutant and wild type strains were evaluated through bacterial adhesion assay, whole blood killing assay and challenge test in mice and piglets. Results: The mutant strain 05ZYH33Δ0946 was successfully constructed. Results of bacterial adhesion assay demonstrated that SSU05_0946 was not involved in the adherence of Streptococcus suis to human epithelial cells. SSU05_0946 was an ovel anti-phagocytic factor and virulence factor of Streptococcus suis. Conclusion: Streptococcus suis type 2 ABC transporter SSU05_0946 is a newly discovered virulence factor of Streptococcus suis, playing an important role in the evasion of host innate immunity by Streptococcus suis.

Methods: NoV GⅡ.4 VLPs in two different conformations were prepared from high-density fermentation of recombinant engineered strains and VLPs purification. Physicochemical properties of the two forms of VLPs were identified by Western blot, size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC), dynamic light scattering(DLS) and transmission electron microscopy. Serum VLPs binding activities and blocking activities against VLPs binding to histo-blood group antigen(HBGA-VLPs) were evaluated after immunization of BALB/c mice with the two forms of VLPs. Results: VLPs of two different diameters with high homogeneity were obtained after purification. DLS results showed that particle sizes of two VLPs were 53.98 nm and 45.18 nm, respectively. The two VLPs were similar in binding abilities to HBGA receptors. Serum VLPs binding activities and blocking activities against HBGA-VLPs were found higher in NoV-VLP-L than NoV-VLP-S, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Conclusion: VLPs in two different conformations were obtained by expressing NoV GⅡ.4 VP1 proteins in Hansenula polymorpha. Though they were similar in physicochemical properties and immunogenicity, the NoV-VLP-L might be potential antigen candidates for the development of recombinant human norovirus vaccine.

Methods: Stratified sampling was used to collect 390 serum sample in 12 age groups with an equal number of males and females as well as resident and floating population. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to detect the concentrations of IgG antibody against measles in different groups. Results: The overall positive rate and protective rate of anti-measles antibody were 78.21% and 41.28%, respectively. No significant difference in the positive rates of antibody was found between males and females, or resident and floating population (P>0.05). Antibody levels varied significantly among different age groups (χ2=191.214, P<0.01). More than 80.00% of the people aged ≥1 year were positive for anti-measles antibody and the positive rates in children 3 to 6 years old and people aged ≥40 years reached 100% and over 90.00%, respectively. Infants under 8 months of age, having the lowest positive rate of antibody (10.00%), were susceptible to measles. The highest protective rate was found in children aged 8 months to 9 years, followed by that in people≥40 years. Levels of anti-measles antibody in people aged 10 to 39 years mainly ranged from 200 mIU/ml to 800 mIU/ml. No significant difference in antibody levels was found among people aged ≥8 months who had different immunization histories (χ2=1.140, P>0.05). Conclusion: The average level of anti-measles antibody was high in Jinshan District in 2015, indicating that the people in that area had a relatively high immunity to measles, but the positive rate of antibody needed to be further improved. Infants under 8 months old and people 10 to 39 years old were the main susceptible groups. It is suggested that measles vaccination efforts should be focused on susceptible population and women of childbearing age to improve herd immunity.

Immediately under the layers containing Roman tombs (the south wall of funerary chamber no.3 of tomb 11) there appeared a large strata of dark-coloured soil in the shape of a cross, containing several layers of a huge amount of different size fish. We separated each one of these and at the end of the season counted approximately 2500 fish. In 2013 we continued excavation work in the area to the southwest and discovered another huge stratum, again in the form of a cross. This stratum contained approximately 3000 fish of the same type, but this time in mummified form. We decided to save the complete excavation of these votive fish deposit remains for a later date, and in 2015 completed the excavations. 97% of the fish were of the Mormyridae family (Mormyrus Cashive and Mormyrus Kannume), in other words Oxyrhynchus, which was the symbol of the city. The other 3% were represented by lepidotes, catfish, and the remains of some cats. The discoveries were, moreover, very important in terms of the funerary cult that developed in the Nome of Oxyrhynchus, and in particular in the High Necropolis. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

679.html,Figurative vase painting from the First Intermediate Period through to the Fatimid Dynasty: A continuity?,"Vase painting is an underestimated branch of Egyptian applied arts, lingering in the shadow of the great achievements of the fine arts. This article aims at introducing the conscient recognition of figurative vase painting as an autonomous and continuous branch of art into Egyptology. In fact, the history of ceramic painting begins gloriously with the Naqada I and II Periods, followed however, by a gap, i.e. its total absence, during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom Periods. From the First Intermediate Period through to the Fatimid Dynasty (c. 2100 BC - c. AD 1200), vessels, bowls, and plates were continuously decorated with motifs or scenes containing human and animal figures. The second half of this long span is characterized by the successive Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Arabic conquests, each provoking drastic cultural alterations clearly reflected by the artistic production of the periods. Noticeably, these changes of culture were unable to break this branch of art, and vase painting was not completely transformed (as was the case with other branches of art); rather, some elements of style and contents were always handed down. A major reason for this kind of permanence may be sought in the specific character of ceramics. Vase painting is absolutely sui generis, implying a technical skill unparalleled in any other artistic discipline. On pottery, the surface to paint on is always curved, either convex or concave, and in both cases turning around the body of the vessel and thus returning into itself. The structure of a vessel calls for symmetry (mirror symmetry, translational symmetry, rotational symmetry, or combinations of these), and artists arranging motifs on a surface made a large use of it. The inside only of relatively flat bowls or plates was felt to be appropriate for more or less freely composed scenes. The specific structure of vessels also calls for the simplification and concentration of motifs, allegoric single figures or groups being the preferred types in vase painting. On a technical level, Egyptian and Nubian artists made no difference between working on pottery or faience, the latter material allowing for a painted decoration as well as a flat relief. Faience was no more in use after the Roman Imperial Period; what is left from the Byzantine Period is unglazed pottery, while the Fatimid artists preferred lustre painting. In the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom, some paradigmatic motifs and decoration schemes were created, such as the hunter, the girl with erotic attributes, the lotus vase, and the fish plate. Some of them may recur regularly, sometimes in modified form, until the Fatimid Period, some may be omitted after a time, and some new ones may be invented at any time subsequent to the Middle Kingdom. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

68.html,"Spatiotemporal assessment and trade-offs of multiple ecosystem services based on land use changes in Zengcheng, China","Driven by rapid urbanization, land use change has become a significant factor influencing ecosystem services (ESs). To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the “Ecological corridor construction” project and the “Grain for Green” project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Sun Xiao; Li Feng,State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China,-,Alternative scenario; Ecosystem services (ESs); Land use change; Trade-offs
680.html,Scenes representing temple rituals on some 21st Dynasty coffins,"The temporary lack of traditional funerary cult places (i.e. private funerary chapels) at the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period may logically have led to the role of temples in funerary rituals during and after the burial becoming increasingly important. It is not surprising, therefore, that a whole series of new pictorial compositions/iconographic motifs were introduced in the Theban private funerary context in the course of the late Ramesside Period and the 21st Dynasty, often referring to non-funerary rituals performed in temples. Among the new compositions one can frequently come across temple ritual scenes and an increasing number of allusions to local and non-local temple rituals. Rites performed during festivals of various funerary deities (e.g. during the Khoiak feast of Osiris) provided a fundamental divine pattern for the deceased and were a guarantee for perpetuating the ritual after death. Osirian rites, which were originally composed for temple use and applied in New Kingdom royal tombs, were recopied and adapted for private use and recited for the benefit of the deceased as early as the first half of the Third Intermediate Period, before becoming more popular in the 'Book of the Dead' versions of the Saite redaction.

681.html,The Berlin Plans from the New Kingdom Period,"Among the various methods of conveying architectural information, the plan has been the most conventional medium since the beginning of ancient civilization. Compared to the architectural finds of Ancient Mediterranean cultures, those of Ancient Egypt provide us additionally with architectural drawings on papyrus. One of the best preserved architectural plans on papyrus can indeed be seen in the Egyptian Museum in Turin. There are also some less known fragments of architectural plans on papyrus containing hieratic notations in the Papyrussammlung der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin. They were brought into the museum by the famous architectural historian Ludwig Borchardt, but have yet to be examined in their entirety. In this paper, these fragments are analyzed in detail. The analysis will show that the fragments of the plans depict two or three temples that were still under construction. Since the paleography suggests the reign(s) of Seti I-Ramesses II, it is likely that the buildings depicted here concern either construction drawings of the projects initiated by these pharaohs, or documentations of the unfinished buildings of the predecessors. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

682.html,The Physiologus in Egypt,"The Physiologus is a work intimately related to Egypt. The author of the essay is unknown, but most likely it was composed in Greek language in Alexandria between the end of the 2nd and the end of the 4th century AD. The direct tradition of the Physiologus in Greek includes a good number of manuscripts belonging to the Middle Ages (from the 10/11th century on), to which was recently added a fragment on papyrus from Egypt dating back to the 6th century (PSI XVI 1577). Among the non-Greek versions, the Coptic Physiologus stands out as one of the most important translations composed around the 5th century AD. We do not have an unbroken, direct witness of the complete work, but some fragments of the text are known, as well as some references to different chapters in the works of other authors. We can then say that the edition of the Physiologus in Coptic relies almost entirely on indirect witnesses of the text. The only direct witness appears to be a fragment of a paper notebook dating back to the 10/11th century AD (P.Berol. Inv. 7999). In this paper I would like to focus firstly on analysing the data on the text of the Physiologus obtained from the two direct witnesses coming from Egypt; secondly on investigating some aspects of the witness of the indirect sources, which are crucial to appreciate the influence that this essay had on Egyptian Christian literature, and to retrace the cultural environment of late ancient Egypt. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

683.html,Economic mentalities and Ancient Egyptian legal documents,"According to Moses Finley, business activities of economic actors in the ancient world were determined by a rentier mentality, i.e. the preference to invest in landed property or priestly prebends in order to accumulate wealth, as well as the tendency to interact economically only within the own family or peer group. Recent research on the economic history of the Ancient Near East draws a more complex picture of economic mentalities in Antiquity and principally distinguishes a rentier and an entrepreneur type. Actors of each type followed their own economic rationality that influenced their business decisions considerably. While reflections on economic mentalities are rarely found in literary sources, legal documents as products of economic transactions like sales, leases, loans, etc. provide insights into the strategies of the business partners involved, as well as the juridical and social environment that determined their economic behaviour. In this paper, I will discuss the identification of different economic mentalities by analysing Egyptian legal documents of the Late Period. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

Rediscovering fragments in the new blockyard at Medinet Habu,"In the Fall of 2007 the Epigraphic Survey decided to undertake the survey of the several hundred loose fragments scattered about the Medinet Habu temple precinct, some of them inscribed and lying face down on the surface, and already showing advanced signs of deterioration caused by groundwater and salt. The blocks were moved into a new blockyard built against the inside south enclosure wall of the complex for inventorying and documentation, as well as conservation as necessary. Between 2007-2011, most of the fragmentary material from Medinet Habu, including the fragments kept in the small blockyard south of the main temple and in a storage room in the great mortuary temple of Ramses III, was transferred into the new blockyard. This collection of more than 4000 fragments is quite diverse, comprising pieces from all periods of the precinct's history, from the early 18th Dynasty, through the abandonment of the Coptic town Djeme in the 9th century AD. The aim of this paper is to introduce a specific corpus within the Medinet Habu fragment collection - a group of doorjambs and lintels from private houses dating primarily to the end of the 20th Dynasty and early Third Intermediate Period. The comparison of the material as currently preserved in the new blockyard with the original documentation of the 1927-1933 Oriental Institute excavations has already led to unexpected and exceptional results, further illuminating our understanding of the early occupational history of the Medinet Habu settlement. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

685.html,Expression of loyalty to the king -A socio-cultural analysis of basilophoric personal names dating to the Old and Middle Kingdoms,"In ancient Egypt names do not only identify an individual and distinguish him/her from fellow human beings, but they can additionally provide valuable information on religious beliefs, social, cultural, and ethical values, as well as political programs. It was very common to adopt a second name at a later point in life, which thus mirrored, to a certain extent, the individual's personality and reputation he/she gained within society. In this vein, a second name could reflect a changing point in the individual's life, such as an exclusive loyalty or devotion to a certain king, which could be expressed for instance through basilophoric personal names. Ancient Egyptians included the name of a ruling king into their personal names to articulate their loyalty to the reigning sovereign, or they incorporated a name of a deceased pharaoh to venerate the ruler. But apart from expressing loyalty to or adoration for a specific king, basilophoric names also convey information on how said kings were characterized by society and how they were put in a certain relationship to a specific god or goddess. Therefore, basilophoric personal names do not only provide information on the name holder, but also on the personality and reputation of a king. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

687.html,Were components of Amarna composite statues made in separate workshops?,"Discussions of Amarna composite statuary often raise the question as to whether different sculptors' workshops specialized in specific components that were ultimately assembled into finished statues. Some scholars have claimed that there definitely was such cooperation, while others consider it a real possibility. Arguments in favor have been based largely on the types of composite pieces found, or not found, in the Thutmose workshop. This sort of simple 'assembly line' creation would have required considerable standardization of the poses and of the measurements for the tenons and mortises on the individual pieces. It has been suggested that the models from the Thutmose workshop and elsewhere were a means of creating such standards. This essay argues that there is no evidence for separate workshops sharing responsibility for making component pieces for composite statues. The types of pieces not found in the Thutmose complex were not found in other workshops either. The models bear no indications of tenons. There is, however, considerable evidence that the statues were made within single workshops, perhaps by small teams of specialists working in close proximity. This evidence comes from the dozens of surviving composite pieces, which display no standardization of tenons. Examples will demonstrate the ingenuity of the artists who devised distinctive tenon designs for a variety of poses. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

688.html,The 'pantheistic' deities. Report from research on iconography and role of polymorphic deities,"One of the most intriguing motifs of Egyptian religious iconography is a representation of the so-called Pantheos - a composite deity with additional animal heads and other animal attributes, along with magic and religious symbols. Deities of this group are commonly described in the Egyptological tradition as 'pantheistic'. Recently, a new name, 'polymorphic deities', was proposed for this iconographical category, which does not force any of the various possible interpretations, but only refers to one visual aspect of the motif (Quack 2006: 175-90). The discussion concerning such polymorphic representations suggests, on the one hand, a possible search for a personal, universal god with a solar, hidden aspect, and, on the other, a magic, practical dimension, providing protection against evil powers and dangers. Studies undertaken in recent years suggest that a polymorphic representation is not a simple visualization of one religious idea or a god, but it expresses diversified versions of popular and official beliefs present in ancient Egypt in the second half of the first millennium BC and later on. The paper reports the author's research on iconography, based on visual and semantic studies of polymorphic Late Egyptian, Ptolemaic and Roman depictions on statuettes, magic stelae, amulets, gems and illustrations of papyri. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

689.html,The 13th Dynasty at Abydos: A royal tomb and its context,"The 13th Dynasty remains an enigmatic period in Ancient Egyptian history. The main sources of information concerning the many kings of this relatively short period are the Turin Canon and a handful of royal tombs. One of the newly re-investigated royal tombs from this period is S9 at South Abydos. The results of these excavations not only allow for a detailed understanding of the architectural components of this and other royal tombs, they also lead to contemplation about the nature of kingship during the mid 13th Dynasty, when significant changes may have occurred in the very fabric of this institution. Choosing Abydos rather than a Memphite necropolis as the location of his tomb, the 13th Dynasty royal owner of S9 may have deliberately separated himself from the earlier rulers to whom he may or may not have been related.

69.html,Atomic and electronic structure of a copper/graphene interface as prepared and 1.5 years after,"We report the results of X-ray spectroscopy and Raman measurements of as-prepared graphene on a high quality copper surface and the same materials after 1.5 years under different conditions (ambient and low humidity). The obtained results were compared with density functional theory calculations of the formation energies and electronic structures of various structural defects in graphene/Cu interfaces. For evaluation of the stability of the carbon cover, we propose a two-step model. The first step is oxidation of the graphene, and the second is perforation of graphene with the removal of carbon atoms as part of the carbon dioxide molecule. Results of the modeling and experimental measurements provide evidence that graphene grown on high-quality copper substrate becomes robust and stable in time (1.5 years). However, the stability of this interface depends on the quality of the graphene and the number of native defects in the graphene and substrate. The effect of the presence of a metallic substrate with defects on the stability and electronic structure of graphene is also discussed © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ponosov Yu.

690.html,Notes on the inscribed Old and Middle Kingdom coffins in the Egyptian Turin Museum,"The Turin collection of coffins from the Old and Middle Kingdoms, the subject of a research project by the author, mainly derives from the excavations of Ernesto Schiaparelli (at Asyut, Qaw el-Kebir and Gebelein) at the beginning of the 20th century. The analysis of the materials offers several suggestions for a funerary tradition which covers the period between the end of the Old Kingdom and the Middle Kingdom; at the same time, the textual collection is coherent within these traditions and which go on to be the main features of the funerary culture of the Middle Kingdom. Among others, some of the research topics discussed here include: -Archaeological contexts: These coffins confirm the prestige of the necropolis investigated by E. Schiaparelli. -Textual data: Because of the origins of the coffins, the Turin collection offers some case-studies of the funerary doctrine between the Old and Middle Kingdoms. The diffusion of the Coffin Texts, well known from the textual collection from the coffins of Iqer (Gebelein), is confirmed by other unpublished sources, mainly from Asyut. -Epigraphical data from the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom scribal traditions. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The hierogrammateis were in charge of sketching mythological and religious geographies, playing a key role in the formation, development and 'administration' of the conceptual space inside the imaginary of the ancient Egyptian society. This paper aims at mapping all the topographical elements, cities, multiple canals, rural territories, and marshlands, which constituted the religious topographical map of the Western Harpoon as imagined by the hierogrammateis. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

694.html,Studies on BD 17 vignettes: Iconographic typology of Rw.tj-scene (New Kingdom - Third Intermediate Period),"The subject of the article is an analysis of the iconography, originating in BD 17 along with a number of its vignettes. The image analyzed consists of two lions sitting back to back and carrying the signs of horizon and sky above them and is frequently named the 'Rw.tj-scene' in scholarly literature. While it is easy to recognize, it has rarely been analyzed individually. I am presenting an iconographic typology of the Rw.tj-scene in the period of the so-called 'Theban recension' of the Book of the Dead (NK - TIP) based on 68 sources, of which 27 are vignettes appearing on papyri; 18 are paintings on tombs walls; 21 drawings on coffins; and another two on other objects. The collected materials result in a first iconographic typology based on the structural and typological approach. 28 individual components, the constituent parts of the scene are referred to with letters from 'A' to 'Z'. Here two basic components are invariable in all compositions (Type III) - the image of lions (A) and the solar disk (B) (frequently incorporated into the sign for 'horizon' (C), but apparently having distinct semantic meaning). The use of other components may vary. Based on the varying combinations of these components and the corresponding compositions' semantic, six iconographic types with several subtypes have been identified, alongside four exceptions - resulting from a synthesis between the Rw.tj-scene and the vignettes of BD 16, 139, and the Sonnenlaufszene. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

695.html,The Egyptian Dionysus: Osiris and the development of theater in Ancient Egypt,"Upholding Classical Greek drama as the benchmark for ancient theater, scholars have historically disregarded the notion of a native Egyptian dramatic tradition, due to the religious and ritualistic nature of the limited evidence available. Yet Greek tragedy began as a featured competition of the Great Dionysia, the most important festival of the god Dionysus in Athens. Traced to the 6th century BC, the religious roots of the Great Dionysia and the dramatic rituals surrounding it reflect those found in Egypt more than one thousand years earlier, in celebration of the Osirian Khoiak Festival. Herodotus first observed the link between Dionysus and Osiris in the mid-5th century BC - a connection the Ptolemies promoted heavily during their reign, essentially presenting Dionysus and Osiris as Greek and Egyptian counterparts of the same deity. In their respective cultures, both gods represented kingship, agriculture and the harvest, human fertility, death and resurrection. Both cults heavily featured dramatic elements in their worship as well. This paper examines the Osirian mysteries and related dramas celebrated during the Khoiak Festival, and illustrates their potential significance in the development of an ancient Egyptian dramatic tradition that pre-dates the advent of theater in ancient Greece. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

696.html,"From Egypt to the Holy Land: First issues on the Egyptian collection in the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum, Jerusalem","The Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem hosts a large quantity of Egyptian materials gathered by Bro. Cleophas Steinhauser during his stay at the Franciscan mission in Cairo in the first two decades of the past century. Still unknown, waiting to be exhaustively presented and displayed, the artefacts cover all phases of ancient Egyptian history, from predynastic times up to the Late Period and the Graeco-Roman period. This paper aims to present the results of a first look at the Egyptian collection, highlighting the most characteristic artefacts such as reliefs bearing pharaonic cartouches, canopic jars, ship and bowmen models, shabtis, amulets and other funerary equipment. Moreover, the study and interpretation of the most interesting piece of the collection, the funerary relief of the steward and scribe Ipy from Tell el Amarna, is accompanied by an effort to retrace the missing portion, in a complex search through collections scattered worldwide. Secondarily, the discussion about the materials aims to retrace the reasons and circumstances that led Steinhauser to choose and collect these items. Further study and the complete publication of these objects can be foreseen in view of their display in the Terra Sancta Museum, a project started January 2015, where these Egyptian finds will finally play a key role. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

697.html,Temple ranks in the Fayyum during the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods: Documentary sources and archaeological data,"According to administrative sources, during the Ptolemaic period the Egyptian temples were divided into three ranks: First-, second- and third-class (prota, deutera, elassona hiera). This classification of sacred buildings apparently left no trace in the papyri of the Roman period, when only the most important temples were called and classified by the epithet logima hiera. This paper aims to understand the rules according to which Egyptian sacred buildings were classified and how these first-, second- and third-class temples were planned and arranged. To this end, an integrated and comparative analysis of different kinds of sources was carried out: All the Graeco-Roman papyri and the inscriptions, which contain rank epithets, were examined and a number of archaeological data about the temples of the Fayyum region was investigated. Based on these sources, it is possible to put forward a number of hypotheses about: When the ranks of the sacred buildings were established, what the amount of land tenure for each class of temples was, and why this classification seems to have changed during the Roman period. Moreover, it is worth noting that three different types of sacred complexes were identified in the Fayyum, with three distinct architectural kinds of sacred buildings and three different organisations of the sacred space, each one associated with a specific temple rank. So, it is possible to outline the distinguishing features of each class of temples. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

F 2014/3.2), allegedly from the eastern Delta. The obverse shows sunk relief decoration in a single register, with the god Khnum working at his potter's wheel, flanked by two fragmentary figures (a cow-headed goddess and a man wielding a pestle). Stylistically, the fragment fits into the 30th Dynasty. Iconographically, it can be demonstrated that the present composition was copied from a prototype developed during the reign of Ramesses II, and known from an architrave of the Luxor temple. It is suggested that there may have been political reasons for this derivation.

This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation. © 2017, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

70.html,A comparison study of adsorption of benzohydroxamic acid and amyl xanthate on smithsonite with dodecylamine as co-collector,"The objective of this paper is to display the results of the flotation and adsorption behaviors of benzohydroxamic acid (BHA), potassium amyl xanthate (KAX), dodecylamine- hydrochloride (DDA), mixed BHA/DDA and KAX/DDA on smithsonite. The flotation results show a collecting ability sequence of BHA > KAX > DDA on smithsonite and the best flotation performance at mixing ratio of 1:4 mol fraction DDA/KAX for mixed collector on smithsonite. The enhancement of smithsonite recovery by co-adsorption of KAX and DDA, while no promotion effect as to mixed BHA/DDA catanionic system, are attributed to the difference in steric effect of absorbed head group. According to the results of zeta potential and contact angle (CA) measurements, a most negative charged and the highest hydrophobic smithsonite surface are attained using KAX with DDA as co-collector, which shows a good agreement with the flotation results. FTIR measurements display the stabilization against oxidation and decomposition of DDA on KAX and the inhibition of preferential adsorbed BHA ions on DDA adsorption. The interaction energies of single and mixed collectors with mineral surface also shows well consistency with experimental results. The adsorption models proposed illustrate the decrease in the electrostatic head–head repulsion and the increase in lateral tail–tail hydrophobic interaction between adjacent KAX anions due to the insertion of DDA cations, while almost no DDA could access to smithsonite surface through adjacent BHA owing to steric effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Zhen; Xu Longhua; Wang Jinming; Wang Li; Xiao Junhui,Key Laboratory of Solid Waste Treatment and Resource Recycle Ministry of Education\Southwest University of Science and Technology\China; State Key Laboratory of Mineral Processing\Beijing\China; School of Resources Processing and Bioengineering\Central South University\China,-,Adsorption model; Catanionic; Flotation; Smithsonite; Steric effect

Methods: After HBHA was confirmed to be able to enter into macrophages by immunofluorescence, mouse BMDM and Raw264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml)+ IFN-γ (2.5 ng/ml), IL-4 (20 ng/ml), HBHA (1 μg/ml, 3 μg/ml, 6 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml) and ESAT-6 (5 μg/ml), respectively. IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α in the supernatants of cell culture were measured by ELISA. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of molecular markers of macrophage polarization [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, Arg-1 and CD206] at mRNA level. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of iNOS and Arg-1 at protein level. Results: Increased secretion of IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α in the supernatants of cell culture and enhanced expression of iNOS and TNF-α at mRNA level were observed after treating BMDM with Mycobacterium tuberculosis HBHA. Similarly, in HBHA-treated Raw264.7 cells, the secretion of IL-6 and the expression of TNF-α were also up-regulated. Mycobacterium tuberculosis HBHA and ESAT-6 had similar effects on murine macrophages. Neither of them could increase the expression of Arg-1, a molecular marker of M2 macrophages, in BMDM at protein level, but both enhanced the expression of iNOS, a molecular marker of M1 macrophages, in BMDM and Raw264.7 cells. Conclusion: Mycobacterium tuberculosis HBHA can induce the polarization of murine macrophages to M1 phenotype.

Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of mdCec4 against Acinetobacter baumannii were detected by microdilution method. Dynamic time-kill curve was monitored by microplate reader. Effects of different influencing factors, such as NaCl, trypsin and pH value, on the antimicrobial activity of mdCec4 were assessed. The ultrastructure of Acinetobacter baumannii exposed to the MIC of mdCec4 was observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: The MIC and MBC of mdCec4 against Acinetobacter baumannii were 4 μg/ml and 8 μg/ml, respectively. The dynamic time-kill curve revealed that mdCec4 had a high antimicrobial activity within 24 hours. The antimicrobial activity of mdCec4 was not affected by NaCl concentration ranged from 0 to 200 mmol/L, but could be inhibited by trypsin at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Among Tris-HCl buffers with different pH values (6.5, 7.5, 8.8), the optimum condition for mdCec4 was pH8.8. Results of SEM showed that the degree of bacterial cell injury was positively correlated with exposing time. Conclusion: This study shows that the newly discovered mdCec4 has a better antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii as it can eliminate Acinetobacter baumannii within a short period of time and its antimicrobial ability can last more than 24 hours. Moreover, mdCec4 has the characteristic of good stability in conditions of different concentrations of NaCl and Trypsin as well as various pH values. SEM observation shows that the MIC of mdCec4 can destroy the integrity of bacterial membrane resulting in a release of a large number of cell contents, which finally lead to the death of Acinetobacter baumannii. This study provides references for further study of the antimicrobial mechanism of mdCec4 against Acinetobacter baumannii.

705.html,Hard Carbon and Li4Ti5O12-Based Physically Mixed Anodes for Superior Li-Battery Performance with Significantly Reduced Li Content: A Case of Synergistic Materials Cooperation,"Li4Ti5O12(LTO) and hard carbon (HC) are commonly used anodes in the Li-ion batteries. LTO has an operating voltage of 1.55 V and exhibits high-rate performance but with limited capacity. HC has high specific capacity but extremely low operating voltage. Herein, we show that a simple physical mixture of the two enhances the half-cell as well as full-cell performance through a synergistic cooperation between the materials. Specifically, the LTO-HC mixed anodes exhibit impressive performance even at high C-rates. This results from a quick internalization of Li ions by LTO followed by their distribution to HC regions via the high density of the winding internal interfaces between the two. The full cells of the LTO-HC mixed anodes with LiCoO2(LCO) evince an enhanced operating voltage window and a well-defined plateau. Because of a reduced irreversible capacity loss in the LCO/mixed anode full cells, the overall specific capacity is better than the LCO/pristine anode full cells. Also, with the LTO-HC 20-80 anode (Li content reduced by 80%), the full cell exhibits an impressive performance when compared to pristine anodes without pre-lithiation. The LCO/mixed anode full cells have excellent cycling stability up to 500 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Sharma Neha; Puthusseri Dhanya; Thotiyl Musthafa Ottakam; Ogale Satishchandra,Department of Chemistry\Centre for Energy Science\India; Department of Physics and Centre for Energy Science\Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)\India,-,-
706.html,Study on potassium nutrient characteristics of fl ue-cured tobacco of diff erent genotypes,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) has a relatively high requirement for potassium(K). In order to study K nutrient characteristics of flue-cured tobacco in depth, characteristics of mineral K activation, absorption, transport and accumulation of different flue-cured tobacco genotypes were studied under normal potassium supply(K+) and non-potassium supply(K-) conditions. Results showed that, the effi ciency of K absorption, K responsivity and K content of high K genotypes were higher than those in low K genotypes. Absorbing ability of root, potassium content and dry matter accumulation of high K genotypes were signifi cantly reduced under K- condition. Low K tolerance ability of high K genotypes was lower than that of low K genotypes. High K genotypes would increase activation of mineral K in growth medium to meet their own needs by increasing root volume and root-shoot ratio under K-condition, but the K content of plant was signifi cantly reduced because the lowest K absorption concentration was higher. High K genotypes is sensitive to K, ability of absorption, transport and accumulation of K and the utilization ratio of K fertilizer are high, but low K tolerance ability is low, which has a guiding signifi cance for high K fl ue-cured tobacco variety breeding and fertilization. © 2017, Editorial Office Chinese Tobacco Society.

Methods: The experiment adopts 15%PEG-6000 treatment. Samples were taken from fresh leaves treated for 0h, 16h, and 24h, respectively. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase activities and malondialdehyde, proline content of LY1306 leaves were measured. Transcriptome sequencing and GO/KEGG analysis were performed. Results: The activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and content of proline of LY1306 increased rapidly under simulated drought stress of 15%PEG. GO analysis showed that some biological processes like response to salt stress and response to gibberellin, and functional genes like transcription factor activity and perinuclear region of cytoplasm were up-regulated in 16h and 24h samples. KEGG pathway analysis showed that plant hormone signal transduction and antigen processing and presentation pathways were up-regulated both in 16h and 24h samples. Conclusion: Peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were major kinases in flue-cured tobacco line LY1306 under 15%PEG simulated drought stress. Proline accumulation plays a positive role in drought resistance. Gibberellin and other plant hormone signaling pathways and varieties of drought related biological processes and metabolic pathways are up-regulated at gene expression level.

713.html,Eff ect of composition diff erences of alkaloid in burley tobacco leaves on TSNAs formation before and after high temperature storage,"Field experiment was set up to select tobacco samples with different alkaloid composition by choosing different nicotine conversion strains of TN86 under the same fi eld management and air-curing conditions. The selected samples were stored in temperature/ humidity-controlled chamber at 45 ℃ for 12 d to explore the source of TSNAs accumulation during high temperature storage and its relationship with alkaloid content. Results showed that signifi cant variation of individual alkaloids existed among 90 tobacco plants with greatest diff erences being observed for nicotine and nornicotine contents. With approximately same levels of total alkaloids, NO3-N and NO2-N contents, TSNAs contents at 45 ℃ for 12 d were signifi cantly higher than those before storage. The increase of NNN and NNK contents during storage was significantly positively correlated with their precursors, nicotine and nornicotine, respectively. With the increase of nornicotine content, the net increase of NNN from nornicotine nitrosation during storage was greater than the net decrease of NNK from nicotine nitrosation, leading to the net increase of total TSNAs content. Results of correlation and stepwise regression analysis showed that the increased percentage of nornicotine caused by nicotine conversion, was the main factor infl uencing TSNAs formation during high temperature storage. It could be concluded that at same levels of total alkaloid, NO3-N and NO2-N content of tobacco leaves, the diff erence in alkaloid composition has signifi cant impact on TSNAs formation and accumulation during leaf storage. © 2017, Editorial Office Chinese Tobacco Society.

To study their performance as surfaces for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC), a set of dye adsorption configurations were evaluated on them, as model dye the small and organic catechol molecule was used. We have calculated adsorption geometry, energy, electronic transfer from dye to semiconductor adsorbent and frontier orbitals by means of density functional theory (DFT). Results show that vacancy-like defected H2Ti3O7(100) and TiO2-B (100) surfaces present favorable adsorption energies. Finally, an adequate energy level alignment make both surfaces prone to be adequate for direct electron transfer upon excitation, from catechol to the conduction band of the semiconductors, with bands located in the Visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Additionally, the band structure alignment indicates an increase in the open circuit voltage, in reference to I2/I3−redox pair potential.

Photoreactions of 6a,b, which contain respective p-methoxyphenylcyclopropane and phenylcyclopropane moieties, form the intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloadducts, endo- and exo-7a,b, along with the dihydroisochroman derivatives, cis- and trans-8a,b. The efficiency of the photoreaction of 6a is higher when benzene rather than acetonitrile is used as a solvent. Interestingly, this solvent effect is reversed in the photoreaction of 6b, where the efficiency is higher in acetonitrile than that in benzene. On the basis of the observed effects of substituents and solvents, fluorescence emission from intramolecular exciplexes, and ΔGs for intramolecular single electron transfer (SET), we propose that the photoreactions proceed through pathways involving the initial formation of singlet intramolecular exciplexes and/or SET between the excited 9-cyanophenanthrene and the ground-state arylcyclopropane moieties. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Maeda Hajime; Sakurai Hisashi; Segi Masahito,Division of Material Chemistry\Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology\Japan,-,-
724.html,JRgui: A Python Program of Joback and Reid Method,"Using the modern object-oriented programing language Python (e.g., tkinter and pandas modules) and a chemoinformatics open-source library (RDKit), the classic Joback and Reid group contribution method was revisited and written into a graphical user interface program, JRgui. The underlying algorithm behind the program is explained, herein, with the users being able to operate the program in either a manual or automatic mode. In the manual mode, the users are required to determine the type and occurrence of functional groups in the compound of interest and manually enter into the program. In the automatic mode, both of these parameters can be detected automatically via user input of the compound simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) string. An additional advantage of the automatic mode is that a large number of molecules can be processed simultaneously by parsing their individual SMILES strings into a text file, which is read by the program. The resulting predicted physical properties along with approximately 200 molecular descriptors are saved in a spreadsheet file for subsequent analysis. The program is available for free at https://github.com/curieshicy/JRgui for Windows, Linux, and macOS 64-bit operating systems. It is hoped that the current work may facilitate the creation of other user-friendly programs in the chemoinformatics community using Python. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Shi Chenyang; Borchardt Thomas B.,Drug Product Development\AbbVie\United States,-,-
725.html,Mutational Analysis of a Conserved Glutamate Reveals Unique Mechanistic and Structural Features of the Phosphatase PRL-3,"Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL)-3 (PTP4A3) has gained much attention in cancer research due to its involvement in tumor promoting and metastatic processes. It belongs to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily and is thought to follow the catalytic mechanism shared by this family, which aside from the conserved active-site amino acids includes a conserved glutamic acid residue that is usually required for the integrity of the active site in PTPs. We noted that in structures of PRL-3, PRL-1, and PTEN these residues do not clearly align and therefore we sought to investigate if the glutamic acid residue fulfills its usual function in these proteins. Although this residue was essential for PTEN's catalytic activity, it was nonessential for PRL-1 and PRL-3. Surprisingly, the mutation E50R increased PRL-3 activity against all tested in vitro substrates and also enhanced PRL-3-promoted cell adhesion and migration. We show that the introduction of Arg50 leads to an enhancement of substrate turnover for both PRL-3 and, to a lesser extent, PRL-1, and that the stronger gain in activity correlates with a higher structural flexibility of PRL-3, likely allowing for conformational adaptation during catalysis. Thus, in contrast to its crucial functions in other PTPs, this conserved glutamic acid can be replaced in PRL-3 without impairing the structural integrity. The variant with enhanced activity might serve as a tool to study PRL-3 in the future. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Hoeger Birgit; Rios Pablo; Berteotti Anna; Hoermann Bernhard; Duan Guangyou; Köhn Maja,Genome Biology Unit\European Molecular Biology Laboratory\Germany; Faculty of Biology\Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (BIOSS)\Germany; University of Heidelberg\Heidelberg\Germany,-,-
726.html,"The Elephant in the Room. On the Relation of Demographic Change, Public Services and Civic Engagement in Germany","In Germany’s territorial planning community, the relation of demographic change, the provision of public services and civic engagement is mainly sketched out as a substitution logic, in which volunteer work substitutes for employed work of state agencies in the provision of public services. The aim of this paper is a critical assessment of this substitution logic. The central question is: how realistic is this fictional model of substitution in the light of current patterns of demographic change in Germany? Methodologically the paper draws on a literature review, which is, first, used to outline definitions and empirical evidence regarding civic engagement in Germany, and second, to present in de-tail and critically reflect the main discourse in German territorial planning regarding the relation of public services and demographic change. The central result is the description of three dilemmas (geographic, political and motivational dilemma), that hinder a realistic implementation of substitution. As a consequence, suggestions are made for a better conceptualization of the relation of public service provision and civic engagement in the light of demographic change. It is argued that civic engagement should more strongly be conceived in combination with tools for recognition, the geographic disparities of civic engagement must be considered more strongly, and state agents must reflect on and redefine their role and self-conception in relation to engaging social groups, with the aim of a more equal partnership. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland 2017.",Nadler Robert,Forschungsgruppe Alltagsmobilität und Verkehrssysteme\ILS – Institut für Landes-und Stadtentwicklungsforschung\Germany,-,Civic Engagement; Demographic Change; Public Services
727.html,"Civic engagement, Co-production and the Model of Equal Living Conditions","Support of civic engagement and co-production aiming at the delivery of public services implies a spatial dilemma. The majority of people engaged are located in prosperous regions that further benefit from public support of civic engagement, while this is less frequent the case for structurally weak regions. The paper empirically confirms the spatial dilemma by analyzing civic initiatives engaged in delivering public services according to their location. The interdependency of engagement and public support can have negative effects for the German model of equal living conditions. However, commitment and co-production can also be stimulated in structurally weak regions. Based on in-depth case study research we discuss activation and success factors of civic initiatives. We conclude that valuation of civic engagement as part of regional development is important, since both prosperous and weak regions benefit from it. Therefore, civic engagement should be supported in weaker regions in particular. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland 2017.",Butzin Anna; Gärtner Stefan,Institut Arbeit und Technik\Munscheidstraße 14\Germany,-,Civic Engagement; Co-production; Equal living conditions; Rural areas; Spatial dilemma

The theoretical backdrop of this contribution is formed by the findings from the international discussion on the impact orientation of time banks that as-cribe to them a certain importance for social inclusion, to strengthen communities and to mitigate the negative effects of economic deprivation. This paper investigates if and to what extent the findings for the Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark (founded in 2011) fit in the international results. For this purpose, data on membership, offer advertisements and on demand as well as the latest network meeting result protocol have been analysed. Additionally, the responsible staff members of the Landentwicklung Steiermark as well as the coordinators of the local time bank groups have been surveyed. The analysis of the result protocol of the latest network meeting confirms the validity of the subjective es-timations of the experts. Empirical data show that women and people aged 50 to 69 years form the backbone of the Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark. Barter activities are less impor-tant than joint activities and there is no reciprocity or rather mutual exchange. Nevertheless, this time bank has positive case-by-case effects on the subjective quality of life of the (active) participants. The future existence of the Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark and its impacts on securing livelihoods is closely tied to stable basic infrastructures at the local level, professional support and a clear portfolio. © The Author(s) 2017.",Fischer Tatjana; Himmelbauer Paul; Jobst Markus,Department für Raum\Landschaft und Infrastruktur\Austria; Department für Geodäsie und Geoinformation\Technische Universität Wien\Austria,-,Austria; Organized neighbourhood assistance; Quality of life; Security of supply; Time banks; Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark

Lots of superwetting absorption materials with 2D or 3D structures are fabricated to efficiently remove oil spill, but the desorption of the absorbed oil is more difficult. Oil contaminants adhere on the surface will decline the performance and reusability of the absorption materials. Discarding or burning them will bring secondary pollution. Faced with these problems, we prepared an oil extractor integrated by a superhydrophobic-superoleophilic stainless steels wire mesh and a 3D porous cellulose sponge with superhydrophilicity-superoleophilicity in air and superoleophobicity in water. The oil extractor can in situ collect oil spill no matter on the water or under the water. More importantly, it is good at underwater oil desorption, which ensure the recovery and reuse of oil, and meanwhile avoid the materials being fouled by oils. More than 85.5% of crude oil could be successfully discharged only in 2 min when the oil-contaminated sponge was placed in water. The findings in this work not only put forward a new strategy for collection and reuse of various “oils”, but also offer a facile method to achieve a combination of two kinds of materials with diverse wettability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Xu Mengya; Wang Gang; Zeng Zhixiang; Chen Junjun; Zhang Xingyuan; Wang Longsheng; Song Weiguang; Xue Qunji,Key Laboratory of Marine Materials and Related Technologies\Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Marine Materials and Protective Technologies\China; Nano Science and Technology Institute\University of Science and Technology of China\China; ShangHai Yinai New Material Technology Co.\Ltd\China,-,Cellulose sponge; Oil recovery; Self-cleaning; Stainless steels wire mesh; Superhydrophobicity; Superoleophilicity; Underwater superoleophobicity

This article outlines a case study of the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program (UCREFRP), a collaborative effort designed to restore the Colorado pikeminnow population on a section of the Colorado River known as the imperiled 15-mile reach. After years of failed litigation, stakeholder efforts to develop water management solutions led to the establishment of the collaborative. This case study elucidates how collaborative governance efforts take shape, and how they can be more comprehensively assessed by drawing on interdisciplinary approaches from natural and social sciences. This case is an enduring example of the way trade-offs and power imbalances must be managed in collaborative governance, and introduces the importance of environmental and ecological justice, that is, how the collaborative process and benefits of collaborative solutions can be distributed more equitably across social and nonhuman stakeholders. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Boone Karie; Huayhuaca Ch'Aska; Ryder Stacia S.,Department of Geosciences\Colorado State University\United States; Center for Collaborative Conservation\Colorado State University\United States; Department of Sociology\Colorado State University\United States,-,-
732.html,Anisotropic Nanoparticles Contributing to Shear-Thickening Behavior of Fumed Silica Suspensions,"Rheological characteristics of a concentrated suspension can be tuned using anisotropic particles having various shapes and sizes. Here, the role of anisotropic nanoparticles, such as surface-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs), on the rheological behavior of fumed silica suspensions in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is investigated. In these mixed-particle suspensions, the concentrations of MWNTs and GONPs are much lower than the fumed silica concentration. The suspensions are stable, and hydrogen-bonded PEG solvation layers around the particles inhibit their flocculation. Fumed silica suspensions over the concentration range considered here display shear-thickening behavior. However, for a larger concentration of MWNTs and with increasing aspect ratios, the shear-thickening behavior diminishes. In contrast, a distinct shear-thickening response has been observed for the GONP-containing suspensions for similar mass fractions (MFs) of MWNTs. For these suspensions, shear thickening is achieved at a lower solid MFs compared to the suspensions consisting of only fumed silica. A significant weight reduction of shear-thickening fluids that can be achieved by this approach is beneficial for many applications. Our results provide guiding principles for controlling the rheological behavior of mixed-particle systems relevant in many fields. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Zabet Mahla; Trinh Kevin; Toghiani Hossein; Lacy Thomas E.; Pittman Charles U.; Kundu Santanu,Dave C.

733.html,Photo-Assisted Synthesis of a Pd-Ag@CQD Nanohybrid and Its Catalytic Efficiency in Promoting the Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reaction under Ligand-Free and Ambient Conditions,"Supported bimetallic nanoparticles are very promising heterogeneous catalysts for carbon-carbon cross-coupling reactions, though reports focusing on their synergistic activity for promoting such reactions are very limited. In the current study, bimetallic Pd-Ag hybrid nanoparticles supported on carbon quantum dots (CQDs), Pd-Ag@CQDs, were synthesized by a facile and fast UV-light-driven (365 nm) one-pot protocol for the first time to investigate such a synergistic activity. The physico-chemical structural features of the Pd-Ag@CQD nanohybrid were evaluated by UV-vis, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, electron-dispersive X-ray, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. The nanohybrid was found to have dimensions in the range of ca. 3-5 nm. The bimetallic Pd-Ag@CQD nanohybrid was utilized as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for promoting the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with aryl bromides and aryl chlorides under ligand-free and ambient conditions. The synergistic activity of the components of the nanohybrid induced catalytic enhancement of the cross-coupling reaction in terms of short reaction times (<1 h) and high yields (>90%). The heterogeneous character of the nanohybrid system also enabled easy separation and recyclability (up to six cycles). © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Bayan Rajarshi; Karak Niranjan,Advanced Polymer and Nanomaterial Laboratory\Department of Chemical Sciences\India,-,-

Here, we report that self-assembling peptide nanofibers bearing CD4+ or CD8+ T cell epitopes are processed through mechanisms of autophagy in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Using standard in vitro antigen presentation assays, we confirmed loss and gain of the adjuvant function using pharmacological modulators of autophagy and APCs deficient in multiple autophagy proteins. The incorporation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain-3 (LC3-II) into the autophagosomal membrane, a key biological marker for autophagy, was confirmed using microscopy. Our findings indicate that autophagy in APCs plays an essential role in the mechanism of adjuvant action of supramolecular peptide nanofibers. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Rudra Jai S.; Khan Arshad; Clover Tara M.; Endsley Janice J.; Zloza Andrew; Wang Jin; Jagannath Chinnaswamy,Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology\University of Texas Medical Branch\United States; Department of Microbiology and Immunology\University of Texas Medical Branch\United States; Sealy Center for Vaccine Development\University of Texas Medical Branch\United States; Division of Surgical Oncology\Robert Wood Johnson Medical School\United States,-,-
735.html,"Role of Biorelevant Dissolution Media in the Selection of Optimal Salt Forms of Oral Drugs: Maximizing the Gastrointestinal Solubility and in Vitro Activity of the Antimicrobial Molecule, Clofazimine","Clofazimine is an antimycobacterial agent that is routinely used for the treatment of leprosy. Clofazimine has also been shown to have high clinical potential for the treatment of many Gram-positive pathogens, including those that exhibit high levels of antibiotic resistance in the medical community. The use of clofazimine against these pathogens has largely been limited by the inherently poor water solubility of the drug substance. In this work, the possibility of repurposing and reformulating clofazimine to maximize its clinical potential is investigated. To achieve this, the potential of novel salt forms of clofazimine as supersaturating drug-delivery vehicles to enhance the aqueous solubility and gastrointestinal solubility of the drug substance was explored. The solution properties of seven novel salt forms, identified during an initial screening process, were examined in water and in a gastrointestinal-like media and were compared and contrasted with those of the free base, clofazimine, and the commercial formulation of the drug, Lamprene. The stability of the most promising solid forms was tested, and their bioactivity against Staphylococcus aureus was also compared with that of the clofazimine free base and Lamprene. Salts forms which showed superior stability as well as solubility and activity to the commercial drug formulation were fully characterized using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Bannigan Pauric; Durack Edel; Madden Conor; Lusi Matteo; Hudson Sarah P.,Department of Chemical Sciences\Bernal Institute\Ireland; Synthesis and Solid State Pharmaceutical Centre\Bernal Institute\Ireland,-,-

Different from the traditional formation process of covalent bond cross-linked PNIPAM-based microgels, a disassembling and reassembling process for PNIPAM-based ionic microgels was observed. During the formation process, loose microgels were first formed in a short time, and then, these loose microgels disassembled into smaller nanogel pieces. Meanwhile, the nanogel pieces reassembled into microgels by electrostatic interaction. After reassembling, large amounts of nanogels could be seen clearly in the interior of PNIPAM-based ionic microgels. The thermo-sensitivity and composition of the final prepared microgels were characterized by dynamic light scattering, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Chen Rui; Jin Xin; Zhu Xinyuan,School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites\China,-,-
737.html,Evaluating community engagement and benefit-sharing practices in Australian wind farm development,"The wind industry is positioned to contribute significantly to a clean energy future, yet the level of community opposition has at times led to unviable projects. Social acceptance is crucial and can be improved in part through better practice community engagement and benefit-sharing. This case study provides a “snapshot” of current community engagement and benefit-sharing practices for Australian wind farms, with a particular emphasis on practices found to be enhancing positive social outcomes in communities. Five methods were used to gather views on effective engagement and benefit-sharing: a literature review, interviews and a survey of the wind industry, a Delphi panel, and a review of community engagement plans. The overarching finding was that each community engagement and benefit-sharing initiative should be tailored to a community's context, needs and expectations as informed by community involvement. This requires moving away from a “one size fits all” approach. This case study is relevant to wind developers, energy regulators, local communities and renewable energy-focused non-government organizations. It is applicable beyond Australia to all contexts where wind farm development has encountered conflicted societal acceptance responses. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Hall Nina Lansbury; Hicks Jarra; Lane Taryn; Wood Emily,The University of Queensland\QLD\Australia; University of New South Wales\NSW\Australia; Embark\VIC\Australia; Independent Communications Contractor\Victoria\Australia,-,-

74.html,Estimation of the proximity of private domestic wells to underground storage tanks: Oklahoma pilot study,"For protecting drinking water supplies, the locations of areas with reliance on private domestic wells (hereafter referred to as “wells”) and their relationship to contaminant sources need to be determined. A key resource in the U.S. was the 1990 Census where the source of domestic drinking water was a survey question. Two methods are developed to update estimates of the areal density of well use using readily accessible data. The first uses well logs reported to the states and the addition of housing units reported to the Census Bureau at the county, census tract and census block group scales. The second uses housing units reported to the Census and an estimated well use fraction. To limit the scope and because of abundant data, Oklahoma was used for a pilot project. The resulting well density estimates were consistent among spatial scales, and were statistically similar. High rates of well use were identified to the north and east of Oklahoma City, primarily in expanding cities located over a productive aquifer. In contrast, low rates of well use were identified in rural areas without public water systems and in Oklahoma's second largest city, Tulsa, each attributable to lack of suitable ground water. High densities of well use may be expected in rural areas without public water systems, expanding cities and suburbs, and legacy areas of well usage. The completeness of reported well logs was tested by counts from neighborhoods with known reliance on wells which showed reporting rates of 20% to 98%. Well densities in these neighborhoods were higher than the larger-scale estimates indicating that locally high densities typically exist within analysis units. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to determine that 27% of underground storage tanks that had at least one well within a typical distance of concern of 300 m (1000 ft). © 2017",Weaver James W.; Murray Andrew R.; Kremer Fran V.,United States Environmental Protection Agency\Office of Research and Development\United States; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education\26 W Martin Luther King Dr.\United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency\Office of Research and Development\United States,-,Contaminated ground water; Geographical Information Systems; Private domestic wells; U.S. Census; Underground storage tanks

Palynoassemblage-I (425.50 to 448 m) is characterized by the dominance of non-striate bisaccates mainly, Scheuringipollenites spp. (43-57%; S. barakarensis, S. maximus, S. tentulus) and Ibisporites spp. (7-15%; I. diplosaccus, I. jhingurdahiensis). Striate bisaccates viz., Striatopodocarpites spp. (10-18%; S. brevis, S.decorus, S. diffuses) and Faunipollenites spp. (5-25%; F. bharadwajii, F. goraiensis, F. varius) are sub-dominant. Palynoassemblage-II (202 - 240 m) is characterized by the dominance of striate bisaccates mainly, Striatopodocarpites spp. (7-38%; S. decorus, S. diffuses, S. brevis, S. ovalis), Faunipollenites spp. (14-38%; F. varius, F. bharadwajii, F.goraiensis) alongwith good percentage of Striasulcites spp. (15-33%; S. tectus, S. ovatus). Stratigraphically significant taxa indicating Late Permian (Raniganj) affinity recorded in the assemblage in rare percentage includes Chordasporites australiensis, Densoisporites sp., Guttulapollenits, hannonicus, Hamiapollenites insolatus, Klausipollenites schaubergeri, Lunatisporites spp. (L. paliensis, L. pellucidus), Osmundacidites sp., Striomonosaccites ovatus, Strotersporites communis and Weylandites obscures.

742.html,"Coralline algae from the hut bay formation (Middle Miocene), Little Andaman, India","The sediments of Hut Bay Formation (Middle Miocene), Little Andaman are characterized by coralline algae, corals and foraminifera. In the present paper, thirteen species belonging to nine genera of coralline algae are described. Out of these, one species (Harveylithon rupestris) is a new record for India. Eight species (Mesophyllum obsitum, M. curtum, M. koritzae, M. commune, Phymatolithon calcareum, Aethesolithon problematicum, Harveylithon munitum and Sporolithon lvovicum) are first time recorded from the study area. The coralline algal assemblages can be broadly differentiated into two associations: one developed in the lower part of the studied succession deposited in deep, cool-water under low-energy conditions, and the other developed in the upper part indicating deposition in shallow, warm-water with high energy conditions. These two associations along with their growth-forms in the study area suggest that the depth, temperature, and hydrodynamic conditions might have fluctuated during deposition of the Hut Bay Formation. It seems that Lithopyllum and Phymatolithon flourished in relatively cool water environment, while Sporolithon, Harveylithon, Lithoporella, and Aetesolithon might have dominated during the warmer interval. © 2017 Palaeontological Society Of India.

These forms are in sediments ranging in age from Aptian to early Cenomanian and are significant to infer the paleoenvironmental conditions of the sediments. In the absence of planktonic forms to fix the top of Albian, the first downhole occurrence of benthic form Epistomina spinulifera at 450m is used to mark the top of Albian. This Epistomina ‘datum’ may be of local significance in marking Albian in the absence of planktonic foraminifera at this level in this area.

The present investigation carried out on 26 samples collected from infratrappean, intertrappean and intratrappeans beds in and around Viri village, Anjar area, Kachchh district, India. The infratrappean (L-1), intratrappeans at the bottom as well as on the top (L-2 and L-6) are considered non-marine in origin as no foraminifera are recorded within these beds. Samples from the central portion of the area documented foraminiferal population which was not described earlier. Foraminiferal assemblages consisting of mainly Rotalia, Elphidium, Quinqueloculina, Nonion group of species within the intermediate intertrappean and intratrappeans (L-3 to L-5) are inferred to be deposited under shallow marine or ocean connected lacustrine environment. Presence of siliciclastic grains, rock-fragments, peloids and bioclasts also clearly indicate shallow water deposition. Increased abundance of Nonion spp., Quinqueloculina spp. as well as presence of planktic foraminifera (Pseudogloborotalia ranikotensis and Globigerina triloculinoides) within the intertrappean bed (L-3) is suggestive of relatively higher water depth at the site during deposition.

Relative sea level changes that occurred during the last 7000 cal BP affecting the coastal vegetation have been documented through palynology in sedimentary cores/trenches retrieved from the Vellar estuary (VE) and Thillaividangan village (TVG) which are 3 km and 10 km away from the coast, respectively in the northeastern Cauvery river delta. Around 6000-7000 cal BP both sites show marine palynomorphs thereby indicating palaeoshoreline extending inland to about 10 km. Retreat in shoreline post 5700 cal BP from TVG and stray presence of salt tolerant Avicennia species from Vellar was recorded. Around 2440 cal BP true mangroves rejuvenated in Vellar indicating approximately 2-3 km ingression of sea water due to configurational changes in the coastal wetland likely induced by geomorphological changes influenced by weakened monsoon that is evidenced by the low percentage of terrestrial and mangrove pollen. At 4000 cal BP, evidences of marine palynomorphs in Vellar, Pichavaram and Coleroon is at present mean sea level but in TS Pettai the marine signatures are about 4m below present mean sea level suggesting ~2-3 m subsidence in TS Pettai i.e. the middle part of North-eastern Cauvery delta which facilitated more diverse mangroves in this part of delta. © 2017 Palaeontological Society Of India.

The pollen assemblage shows the dominance of conifers with excessively high frequencies of Pinus cf. wallichiana, whereas Cedrus deodara, Abies, Picea are recorded consistently with moderate values. The overall good representation of all these taxa depicts the profuse presence of coniferous forests on the adjoining lower hill slopes. The steady presence of thermophillous broad-leaved elements viz., Betula utilis, Alnus, Juglans and Corylus in low frequencies along with stray pollen Quercus cf. semecarpifolia, Salix, Ulmus, etc. reflects their occurrence in restricted pockets in the region. The poor presentation of all these taxa could also be attributed to their low pollen productivity owing to entomophilous mode of pollination as well as their sparse presence in the local flora. The partial preservation of their pollen in the sediments cannot be denied. The grass pollen together with good representation of sedges, Chenopodiaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae and Artemisia in the pollen rain substantiate their actual presence in the herbaceous complex. © 2017 Palaeontological Society Of India.

747.html,Scalable Chitosan-Graphene Oxide Membranes: The Effect of GO Size on Properties and Cross-Flow Filtration Performance,"Chitosan (CS)-graphene oxide (GO) composite films were fabricated, characterized, and evaluated as pressure-driven water filtration membranes. GO particles were incorporated into a chitosan polymer solution to form a suspension that was cast as a membrane via evaporative phase inversion allowing for scale-up for cross-flow testing conditions. Morphology and composition results for nano and granular GO in the CS matrix indicate that the particle size of GO impacts the internal membrane morphology as well as the structural order and the chemical composition. Performance of the membranes was evaluated with cationic and anionic organic probe molecules and revealed charge-dependent mechanisms of dye removal. The CSGO membranes had rejections of at least 95% for cationic methylene blue with mass balances obtained from measurements of the feed, concentrate, and permeate. This result suggests the dominant mechanism of removal is physical rejection for both GO particle sizes. For anionic methyl orange, the results indicate sorption as the dominant mechanism of removal, and performance is dependent on both GO particle size and time, with micrometer-scale GO removing 68-99% and nanometer-scale GO showing modest removal of 29-64%. The pure water flux for CSGO composite membranes ranged from 2-4.5 L/m2h at a transmembrane pressure of 344 kPa (3.44 bar), with pure water permeance ranging from 5.8 × 10-3to 0.01 L/m2h kPa (0.58-1.3 L/m2h bar).

From 1998 to 2008, the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming experienced an energy boom as a result of technological innovation that enabled the extraction of coalbed methane (CBM). The boom resulted in over 16,000 wells being drilled in this 20,000 square-mile region in a single decade. As of May 2017, 4,149 natural gas wells now sit orphaned in Wyoming as a result of industry bankruptcy and abandonment. The current orphaned wells crisis was partially enabled by the patchwork of surface and mineral ownership in Wyoming that is a result of a legal condition referred to as split estate. As the CBM boom unfolded in this landscape and then began to wane, challenges emerged most notably surrounding stalled reclamation activities. This case illuminates these challenges highlighting two instances when split estate contributed to issues between landowners and industry operators which escalated to litigation. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Walsh Kathryn Bills,Department of Earth Sciences\Resources and Communities Research Group\United States,-,-

The main human urinary metabolites of caffeine were measured in the urban wastewater of ten European cities and the metabolic profiles in wastewater were compared with the human urinary excretion profile. A good match was found for 1,7-dimethyluric acid, an exclusive caffeine metabolite, suggesting that might be a suitable biomarker in wastewater for assessing population-level caffeine consumption. A correction factor was developed considering the percentage of excretion of this metabolite in humans, according to published pharmacokinetic studies. Daily caffeine intake estimated from wastewater analysis was compared with the average daily intake calculated from the average amount of coffee consumed by country per capita. Good agreement was found in some cities but further information is needed to standardize this approach.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of the Modified Optimal Velocity Model (MOVM). Specifically, we analyze the MOVM in three regimes – no delay, small delay and arbitrary delay. In the absence of reaction delays, we show that the MOVM is locally stable. For small delays, we then derive a sufficient condition for the MOVM to be locally stable. Next, for an arbitrary delay, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the local stability of the MOVM. We show that the traffic flow transits from the locally stable to the locally unstable regime via a Hopf bifurcation. We also derive the necessary and sufficient condition for non-oscillatory convergence and characterize the rate of convergence of the MOVM. These conditions help ensure smooth traffic flow, good ride quality and quick equilibration to the uniform flow. Further, since a Hopf bifurcation results in the emergence of limit cycles, we provide an analytical framework to characterize the type of the Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic orbital stability of the resulting non-linear oscillations. Finally, we corroborate our analyses using stability charts, bifurcation diagrams, numerical computations and simulations conducted using MATLAB. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Kamath Gopal Krishna; Jagannathan Krishna; Raina Gaurav,Department of Electrical Engineering\Indian Institute of Technology Madras\India,-,Car-following models; Convergence; Hopf bifurcation; Stability; Time delays; Transportation networks

The patients with intraperitoneal metastases and without distant metastases can benefit from cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Because up to a half of patients live for at least 5 years after this treatment, the treatment is used more and more often. The treatment of patients with intraperitoneal metastases with CRS and HIPEC costs more than the majority of other medical procedures, because CRS is extensive and takes a lot of time, and after surgery, patients need intensive care and expensive medications and equipment. Currently, only 40% to 80% of costs of CRS and HIPEC are reimbursed in Poland. Because CRS and HIPEC mean a financial loss to hospitals, they are rarely performed. We analyzed the costs of treating patients with peritoneal metastases by CRS and HIPEC in two centers (Gdank, Wroclaw) and showed how this treatment is reimbursed outside Poland. We discussed whether adequate qualification of patients and experience of the teams giving the treatment could reduce the costs. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",Jastrzebski Tomasz; Bebenek Marek,Department of Surgical Oncology\Medical University of Gdansk\Poland; Department of Surgical Oncology\Lower Silesian Oncology Center\Poland,-,HIPEC; medical costs; metastases to the peritoneum

757.html,Clear Cell Carcinoma of the abdominal wall,"Background: Clear cell carcinoma in scars after cesarean section is extremely rare, with only 22 cases reported in the literature. Management of this condition needs to be further explored. Here, we report of a patient with clear cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall that developed 35 years after cesarean section. Case Report: The material of the study was a group of 61 patients divided into two groups. Group I - 35 deaf or with profound sensorineural hearing loss children (the pupils of the deaf and hard of hearing school), aged 5-17 years (average 9,2 years), 14 males, 21 females, II - control group comprised 26 normal hearing patients, aged 5-16 years (average 10,4 years), 14 males, 12 females (patients of Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Audiology and Phoniatrics, Medical University of Lodz). In both groups, exon 2 sequencing of GJB2 gene was performed. Results. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our department due to abdominal pain and a progressively growing mass in the abdominal wall. Based on biopsy, a preliminary diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma was made. A wide surgical excision of the tumor with clear margins, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and abdominal wall reconstruction using synthetic mesh were performed. The patient was discharged in good condition after fifteen days of hospitalization. The patient remained recurrence-free 6 months after the treatment. Conclusions: T Lack of standardized management of rare malignant transformations hinders patient care. Due to a growing number of cesarean deliveries, we can expect clear cell carcinoma prevalence of the abdominal wall to increase. Therefore, patients and clinicians should attend to any pain, itching, or change in the size of abdominal wall scars. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",Ewa Kostrzeba; Marianna Barczyk; Mateusz Wichtowski; Rafał Garstecki; Dawid Murawa,Oncological and General Surgery Ward i\Greater Poland Cancer Center\Poland; Department of General and Minimally Invasive Surgery\Hospital Baptismal Monument in Poland in Gniezno\Poland,-,cesarean delivery; Clear cell carcinoma; malignant transformation scar
758.html,Predictors of recanalization after endovascular treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms,"Introduction. Posterior circulation aneurysms account for approximately 30% of all intracranial aneurysms, and their rupture often causes aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Because surgical treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms is difficult, endovascular treatment is commonly indicated. However, simple coil embolization is associated with a high rate of recanalization. Our goal was to investigate morphometric aneurysmal features assessed on pre-embolization computed tomography angiography (CTA) as predictors of recanalization in patients with posterior circulation aneurysms. Material and Methods. We retrospectively analyzed data of 24 patients who underwent coil embolization due to rupture of saccular posterior circulation aneurysms. The morphometric features of aneurysms were measured based on pre-embolization 3D-CTA-aneurysm models, and aneurysmal size and volume were measured on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. The effectiveness of initial endovascular treatment was determined visually with the modified Raymond Roy classification directly after embolization and on follow-up DSAs. Recanalization was diagnosed when, compared to the primary embolization aneurysm appearance, compaction and filling of the aneurysm occurred. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 13.1 software. R esults. Higher maximal aneurysm height perpendicular to the aneurysmal neck was associated with a greater aneurysm recanalization risk (12.12±5.13mm vs. 7.41±3.97mm, p=0.039), and this relationship remained significant after adjustment for patient's age, sex and aneurysm localization (OR=1.26, 95%CI: 1.01-1.60, p=0.047). Maximal aneurysm height perpendicular to the aneurysmal neck distinguished well between recanalized and non-recanalized aneurysms (AUC=0.755, 95%CI: 0.521- 0.989, p=0.033). C onclusions. Predictors of aneurysm recanalization can help choose best endovascular treatment strategies, which could reduce complication rates. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",Wiśniewski Karol; Tomasik Bartłomiej; Bobeff Ernest J.; Stefanczyk Ludomir; Jaskólski Dariusz J.,Department of Neurosurgery and Neurooncology\Medical University of Lodz\Poland; Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine\Medical University of Lodz\Poland; Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging\Medical University of Lodz\Poland,-,embolization; posterior circulation aneurysms; predictors; subarachnoid hemorrhage

76.html,High performance polydopamine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanospheres for U(VI) removal,"This work reports the fabrication of polydopamine-functionalized mesoporous silica (mSiO2/PDA) nanospheres for removing U(VI) from aqueous solution. The maximum adsorption capacity of mSiO2/PDA is 332.3 mg/g at 318.15 K and pH = 5.5. In comparison to the pristine mSiO2, the adsorption capacity of mSiO2/PDA has been remarkably enhanced, which can be ascribed to the large amounts of functional groups existed on the surface of mSiO2/PDA. The adsorption process fits well with the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The adsorption isotherm follows the Langmuir isotherm model, revealing a monolayer adsorption of U(VI) onto mSiO2/PDA. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process. Additionally, this adsorption process is pH-dependent, while the effect of ionic strength is negligible.                          © 2017",Bai Linfeng; Duan Shengxia; Jiang Wanquan; Liu Mei; Wang Sheng; Sang Min; Gong Xinglong; Li Jiaxing; Xuan Shouhu,Department of Chemistry\Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology\China; CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials\Department of Modern Mechanics\China; Key Laboratory of Novel Thin Film Solar Cells\Institute of Plasma Physics\China,-,Adsorption; Dopamine; Mesoporous silica; U(VI)
760.html,Checklist in colorectal surgery-proposal of experts of the Polish Club of Coloproctology and National Consultant in general surgery,"A checklist is a collection of information that helps reduce the risk of failure due to limitations in human memory and attention. In surgery, the first Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC), created under the supervision of WHO (World Health Organization), was established in 2007 and covers three stages related to the patient's stay in the operating theater and operation: 1. Prior to initiation (induction) of anesthesia; 2. before cutting the skin; 3. before the patient leaves the operating room Colorectal surgery is particularly at high risk for complications and relatively high mortality. Elimination or, more likely, reducing the risk of complications by standardizing perioperative procedures may be particularly important in this group. The introduction of ""dedicated"" colorectal checklist surgery seems to be justified. The checklist proposed by the authors in colorectal surgery is divided into four stages, in which conscientious completion of checklists is intended to reduce the potential risk of complications due to hospitalization and surgical treatment. The presented checklist is obviously not closed, as a new publications or recommendations appear, some points may be modified, new issues may be added to the checklist. At present, however, it is a tool considering the well-known and confirmed elements of intraoperative procedures, the compliance of which may significantly reduce the rate of adverse events or surgical complications. © 2018 Fundacja Polski Przeglad Chirurgiczny.",Banasiewicz Tomasz; Krokowicz Łukasz; Richter Piotr; Dziki Adam; Krokowicz Piotr; Lorenc Zbigniew; Szczepkowski Marek; Drews Michał; Wallner Grzegorz,Department of General and Endocrine Surgery and Gastroenterological Oncology\Poznan University of Medical Sciences\Poland; First Department of General\Oncological and Gastroenterological Surgery\Poland; Department of General and Colorectal Surgery\Medical University of Lodz\Poland; Department of General and Colorectal Surgery\Poznan University of Medical Sciences\Poland,-,Checklist; colorectal surgery; surgical complications

768.html,The Effect of Raw Physicochemical Properties on the Quality of Extruded Texturized Vegetable Protein,"Objective: Extruded texturized vegetable protein is one of important products in vegetable protein processing industry. Analyzing factors and results that affects the quality of extruded texturized vegetable protein will help to improve the quality, enrich the type, and promote sustainable development of vegetable protein processing industry.Method: To meet the technology and product developing demands of vegetable protein processing industry, it is reviewed that how the physicochemical properties of raw materials, like components, composition, and additives affect the fiber formation degree, fiber strength, water holding capacity, color, surface smoothness, hardness, and elasticity of extruded texturized vegetable protein. Results: Along with raw material protein content increasing, the fiber formation degree of extruded texturized protein will increase first but then decrease at 57%60% protein content, fiber strength, elasticity or hardness increases, and color will become light first but then dark at 70% protein content. Along with the 11 S/7 S ratio of raw materials increasing, the fiber formation degree or water holding capacity of extruded texturized protein will increase, however, fiber strength or elasticity decreases, and color will become dark. Along with protein nitrogen solubility index increasing, the fiber formation degree or surface smoothness will increase, and color will become light. Adding starch will increase the fiber formation degree, however, decrease surface smoothness of extruded texturized protein.Adding fat will decrease the fiber formation degree, water holding capacity and hardness, but increase surface smoothness. With moisture content increasing, water holding capacity will decrease, and elasticity or hardness will increase first but then decrease. Adding monoglyceride will increase the fiber formation degree and surface smoothness. Adding salt will increase the fiber formation degree, but darken the color. Adding L-cysteine will decrease water holding capacity and darken the color. Neutral or weak alkaline pH will increase the fiber formation degree and water holding capacity. Conclusion: Protein aggregation may be the essence of vegetable protein texturization. Molecular structure, biological macromolecules, oxidation-reduction agent and ionic strength adjustment, which have been known having influence on the protein aggregation, will affect the quality level of extruded texturized vegetable protein. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

The long-term effect of manuring and fertilization on stability of SOM in rice–potato–wheat (R-P-W) and maize–potato–onion (M-P-O) cropping systems was studied in an Inceptisol of semi-arid subtropical India. Soil samples were collected (0–15 and 15–30 cm soil depths) from the following treatments: control, 100% NPK–Fertilizer, 100% N–Vermicompost (VC), 50% NPK − Fertilizer + 50%N − Vermicompost (VC), 100%NPK − Fertilizer + crop residue (CR), 100% N − VC + CR. The stability of SOM was studied by correlating the ammonium oxalate extractable Fe, Al and Si with stable soil organic C (SOC). Application of 100% N–VC and 100% N–VC + CR increased the SOC stock by 66% and 32%, respectively over 100% NPK in R-P-W cropping system, while in M-P-O system, the above treatments increased the SOC stock by 28% and 12%. As compared to 100%NPK, the integrated use of 50%NPK + 50%N–VC increased the SOC stock by 58% and 35% in R-P-W and M-P-O system, respectively. The extractable Fe, Al and Si significantly correlated with stable OC and the multiple regression model developed between these parameters could well predict the stable OC in soil. Complete or partial substitution of chemical fertilizer N with VC could be a promising nutrient management strategy for enhancing the SOC stock in Inceptisol under potato-based cropping systems of semi-arid sub-tropical India. However, the integrated use of 50%NPK + 50%N–VC could be promising due to lowest yield reductions and moderate SOC sequestration potential. The enrichment (47%), as well as quality (81%) of SOC was higher in R-P-W system than in M-P-O system. The organic treatments like 100%NPK + CR and 100%N–VC + CR showed higher stability of SOC in R-P-W (31% and 26%) than in M-P-O cropping system. The stability of SOC could well be predicted by extractable amorphous and poorly crystalline Fe, Al and Si and SOC in both the cropping systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Division of Soil Science & Agricultural Chemistry\ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute\India; ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute Center\Modipuram\India,-,Al and Si; Amorphous Fe; Soil organic C; Stable organic C
770.html,Effect of Different Sterilization Methods on Volatile Flavor Compounds of Prepared Pork Slices,"The purpose of this paper was to study the effects of three different sterilization methods on the flavor of prepared pork slices from raw materials during cold storage at 4 ℃. The samples were pretreated by pasteurization (90℃, 30 min), high hydrostatic pressure sterilization (HHP 550 MPa, 25 ℃), pressure-assisted thermal sterilization (PATS550 MPa, 50 ℃) and stored at 4 ℃. The SPME-GC-MS technology was used to detect and analyze the volatile flavor compounds in prepared pork and sterilized pork slices during storage. Results showed that prepared pork had a variety of volatile aromatic components, including aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes olefins, heterocyclic compounds. The content of aldehydes and alcohols together was hightest, which accounted for about 60 percent of total pork aroma components. Aldehydes mainly contributed to the pork aroma. In the storage period, the content of aldehydes in PATS and pasteurization groups were on the rise, and pasteurization group reaching the highest level at 25 day among others. The levels of pentanal and hexanal in PATS group were higher than in HHP group, but lower than in pasteurized group, which was due to the formation of aldehydes resulting from lipid degradation and Maillard reaction.What's more, the content of alcohols in HHP was highest. At the same time, 1-hexanol and hexanoic acid in PATS sterilizated pork were between HHP and pasteurized groups in shelf life. The study reported that the concentration of aldehydes and alcohols were too high to produce an unpleasant odor. So PATS could promote the formation of aroma flavor by increasing lipid degradation and Maillard reaction, and control the generation of corruption flavor. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

Methods: The protein was extracted by liquid nitrogen grinding in a lysis buffer. Intraperitoneally injection of protein extracts was used to stimulate allergic responses in ICR mice. The indirect ELISA was employed to test the levels changes of specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies in sera of mice, and the symptom scores were evaluated during different stages of the challenging period. Furthermore, shrimp major allergens were identified by two-dimensional immunoblotting using sera from subjects with shrimp allergy, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the peptide digest. Results : The allergic symptoms showed in a dose-dependent manner in mice, and injection of high dose (1.0 mg) of protein can significantly (P<0.05) increase the levels of specific IgE and IgG1 in sera and contribute to the obvious symptoms compared with the control. In addition, two kinds of allergens were identified as arginine kinase (MW: 40.2 ku, PI: 6.0 and 6.2) and tropomyosin (MW: 35.8 ku, PI: 4.6) in the species of Chinese shrimp by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Conclusion: Injection of Chinese shrimp proteins is able to evoke the allergic responses in mice. The major allergens are tropomyosin and arginine kinase, and the latter might have two forms of post-translational modifications. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

774.html,Effect of the Assimilable Nitrogen on the Aroma Compounds Production and the Regulation of Their Biosynthesis during Alcoholic Fermentation,"Nitrogen compounds in grape must are essential to the growth of yeast during alcoholic fermentation. They can also regulate the formation of volatile metabolites of yeast in a decisive way, such as higher alcohols, ketonic acids, esters and volatile sulphur compounds, which make up the majority of wine fermentation aroma. Some amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and methionine) are directly transformed to α-keto acids and their corresponding higher alcohols and acids by yeast via the Ehrlich pathway. Optimal nitrogen source composition and nitrogen supplementation could increase the formation of desirable aroma compounds and decrease the accumulation of undesirable volatile compounds. In this paper, the current studies on the link between the formation of aroma compounds in wine and the composition of nitrogen compounds in must were reviewed. The metabolism of these volatile compounds precursor amino acids and the regulation of the related genes were discussed. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

The results showed that the numbers of yeasts presented a changing rule of ‘rapid rise-stability' during former fermenting in vat, and a characteristic of ‘slowly rising-slowly falling' were shown during later fermenting in jar. On the whole, although the numbers of yeasts in fermented mash during a production cycle with nearly 90 days sometimes fluctuated, they would slowly reduce. All the yeasts in fermented mash in Jiafan rice wine were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the comparison results of 26 S r DNA D1/D2 sequences between test strains and type strain, it can be concluded that the kinds of yeasts in fermented mash were single, and they were not pure. The traditional production process of Jiafan rice wine was not the fermentation of pure Saccharomyces cerevisiae.They were the fermentation of at least three strains, and strain II might play a more important role. That researches about the changing rule of yeasts numbers in fermented mash of Jiafan rice wines was representative during the fermentation of traditional Shaoxing rice wine. Yeasts participating in the brewing of Shaoxing Jiafan rice wine were separated and identified, at the same time strain resources were collected systematically.

779.html,The Effect of Food Nutritive Components on the Formation of Furan in Ascorbic Acid Model System,"To investigate the effect of different food components on the generation of furan in ascorbic acid model, different content of these components (monosaccharides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, minerals) are added to the system. Then these models were heated in oil bath at 121 ℃ for 30 minutes to simulate the sterilization of canned food, and headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS) was applied to monitor the furan content. The results demonstrated that galactose has a stimulative effect on the formation of furan in ascorbic acid model, while glucose has a double effect which depends on its content. Linoleic acid and linolenic acid both has a stimulative effect on the formation of furan in ascorbic acid model, and the promoting effect of linolenic acid is higher than linoleic acid. Among three amino acids (serine, threonine and glutamic acid), addition (<2 mg) has an inhibitory effect on the ascorbic acid model, addition (>10 mg) has a promoting effect on the formation of furan. Ferric and magnesium has a promoting effect on the formation of furan in ascorbic acid model, and that addition of low content of calcuim has a stimulative effect on the formation of furan in ascorbic acid model, while high addition has an inhibitory effect. Moreover, zinc has a little inhibitory effect on the ascorbic acid model. The mechanism of the formation of furan in two element system is relatively complex, furan precursors not only promote to generate furan, but also inhibit the formation of furan because of competitive reaction in system. And the effect of metal elements on the formation of the ascorbic acid is very much dependent on the nature of its own. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

In field studies outside 17 homes within 800 m of sand mining activities (mining, processing, and transport), respirable (PM4) crystalline silica concentrations were low (< 0.4 μg/m3) with crystalline silica detected on 7 samples (2% to 4% of mass). In long-term monitoring at 6 homes within 800 m of sand mining activities, the highest daily mean PM concentrations observed were 14.5 μg/m3for PM2.5and 37.3 μg/m3for PM10, although infrequent (< 3% of time), short-term elevated PM concentrations occurred when wind blew over the facility. In laboratory studies, aerosolized sand was shown to produce respirable-sized particles, containing 6% to 19% crystalline silica. Dispersion modeling of a mine and processing facility indicated that PM10can exceed standards short distances (< 40 m) beyond property lines. Lastly, fence-line PM and crystalline silica concentrations reported to state agencies were substantially below regulatory or guideline values, although several excursions were observed for PM10when winds blew over the facility. Taken together, community exposures to airborne particulate matter from proppant sand mining activities at sites similar to these appear to be unlikely to cause chronic adverse health conditions. © 2017",Peters Thomas M.; O'Shaughnessy Patrick T.; Grant Ryan; Altmaier Ralph; Swanton Elizabeth; Falk Jeffrey; Osterberg David; Parker Edith; Wyland Nancy G.; Sousan Sinan; Stark Aimee Liz; Thorne Peter S.,The University of Iowa\Iowa City\United States,-,Air pollution; Crystalline silica; Hydraulic fracturing; Particulate matter; Proppant sand; Sand mining

797.html,Study on Water Transfer during the Drying Process of Chinese Dried Noodles,"Drying process is an important operation during the production of Chinese dried noodle (CDN), but there is still a lack of relevant scientific basis and standards for the optimization and equipment design of drying process. In this paper, the drying experiments of CDN under different conditions were studied by using the technical platform of food moisture analysis as the research platform. The effects of drying conditions (i.e. air temperature and relative humidity) on moisture content and drying rate were studied by the drying kinetics curves during the drying process of CDN. The changes of water state and water distribution in the drying process of CDN were analyzed from the transverse relaxation time (T2) and MRI images, which were both measured by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMI20-030 H-I). The changes of temperature profiles and moisture profiles during the drying process of CDN were observed intuitively through establishing a heat and mass transfer mathematical model during the drying process of CDN. The research results systematically showed the moisture transfer law in the drying process of CDN, the changing of moisture profiles and temperature profiles in CDN, and the relationships between drying conditions and control parameters. These achievements provide a theoretical basis and technical reference for the optimization and intelligent control of the drying process. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

[Methods] BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with β-Lactoglobulin (β-Lg), the sensitized splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with different doses of butyrate. The proliferation of splenocytes were tested by MTT colorimetry. The total Ig E and related cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, TNF-β, IL-6, TGF-β and IL-17) were detected by ELISA assay, the levels of GPR41 and GPR43 m RNA expressiom were measured by RT-PCR. [Results] Treatment with different doses of sodium butyrate significantly suppressed β-Lg induced proliferation of lymphocytes from sensitized mice and Ig E production. Furthermore, application of higher concentration of sodium butyrate markedly inhibited the production of IL-17, IL-6 and TNF-β, but increased the production of TGF-β when compared with the allergy group (P<0.05). Especially, sodium butyrate significantly up-regulated GPR41 and GPR43 receptor expression in a dose-dependent manner.[Conclusion] Sodium butyrate could inhibit the proliferation of sensitized lymphocytes and play anti-inflammation function through G protein receptor. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.

799.html,Impact of land use activities in the Maumee River watershed on harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie,"One of the focal events motivating the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 was the decline of water quality in Lake Erie, which was originally linked to insufficient treatment of wastewater in some of the biggest adjacent urban centers. The passing of the CWA and the adoption of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in the early 1970s contributed to the quick improvement of water quality in the two ensuing decades, but the 1990s saw the return of water quality problems, indicated by the return of algal blooms to Western Lake Erie. Algal blooms typically occur when excess nutrients are produced by mixture of agricultural and urban practices, and they may threaten ecological stability and public health for millions dependent on the lake for drinking water, tourism, and fisheries. In this case study, we explore the relationship between human behavior and water quality impairments that lead to harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), and in particular, the Maumee River Watershed. The case is designed to be taught in eight class meetings to an audience of upper-level undergraduate students, and has been tested in the classroom in consecutive semesters starting in the fall of 2015. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Berardo Ramiro; Formica Francesca; Reutter Jeffrey; Singh Ajay,School of Environment and Natural Resources\The Ohio State University\United States; Ohio Sea Grant College Program\Stone Laboratory\United States; Department of Forestry and Natural Resources\Purdue University\United States,-,-
8.html,"Ecological response to change in land use at the county level: A case study of landscape patterns in Xinzheng City, Henan Province","[Background] Rapid economic development and population growth in China have led to both environmental deterioration and ecological disturbance in different regions. By studying the effects of change in landscape patterns on Ecological Services Value (ESV), we can gain a better understanding of the changes in regional environments and ecologies. This understanding can lead to the creation of a healthier environment and more harmonious ecosystems. [Methods] We examined remotely sensed satellite images of Xinzheng City that were obtained in 2005, 2010, and 2015. Changes in land use were quantified in order to create landscape patterns for Xinzheng City over ten years. Then we analyzed the changes in landscape patterns using values of typical landscape pattern indexes. A method developed from Costanza's calculation was used to estimate ESV. We also analyzed the effects of landscape pattern change on ESV. [Results] Farm land and build-up land were the two main landscape types in Xinzheng City. The total area of farm land decreased, but the total area of build-up land increased significantly over ten years. The landscape types were mainly changed from farm land, forest land and grassland to the build-up land and waters. The patch density, the maximum patch index and the spatial pattern of different landscape types changed in varied degrees, while the landscape diversity index increased as the dominance index and the extent of fragmentation decreased.. The ESV of Xinzheng City declined slowly at first and then declined sharply. The total decrease in ESV of Xinzheng City was 34. 94 × 106 RMB Yuan over ten years, of which the ESV of farm land decreased by a maximum of 34. 06 × 106 RMB Yuan. The ESV of build-up land showed the most significant change, an increase of 59. 17 %. In terms of spatial distribution, the ESV of Xinzheng downtown was low, while in the southwestern and northwestern areas the ESV was high. During the 10 years from 2005 to 2015, the areas with low ESV grew, and thus the spatial distribution of ESV became more uneven. [Conculsions] This study shows that the reduction of farm land and forest land and the increase in build-up land are the main reasons for ecological deterioration and the related decrease in total ESV. We provide a scientific assessment of the ecological benefits of soil and water conservation projects and a scientific baseline for the overall planning of future land use in Xinzheng City. © 2017, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.

In this study, six air pollution monitoring campaigns (including major regulated air pollutants) were carried out from 2013 to 2015 at both sides of the bridge, located in the urban areas of Rio and Antirrio respectively. Pollution data were statistically analyzed and air quality was characterized using US and European air quality indices. From the overall campaign, it was found that air pollution levels were below the respective regulatory thresholds, but once at the site of Antirrio (26.4 and 52.2 μg/m3for PM2.5and ΡΜ10, respectively) during the 2nd winter period. Daily average PM10and PM2.5levels from two monitoring sites were well correlated to gaseous pollutant (CO, NO, NO2, NOxand SO2) levels, meteorological parameters and factor scores from Positive Matrix Factorization during the 3-year period. Moreover, the elemental composition of PM10and PM2.5was used for source apportionment. That analysis revealed that major emission sources were sulfates, mineral dust, biomass burning, sea salt, traffic and shipping emissions for PM10and PM2.5, for both Rio and Antirrio. Seasonal variation indicates that sulfates, mineral dust and traffic emissions increased during the warm season of the year, while biomass burning become the dominant during the cold season. Overall, the contribution of the Charilaos Trikoupis bridge to the vicinity air pollution is very low. This is the result of the relatively low daily traffic volume (~ 10,000 vehicles per day), the respective traffic fleet composition (~ 81% of the traffic fleet are private vehicles) and the speed limit (80 km/h) which does not favor traffic emissions. In addition, the strong and frequent winds further contribute to the rapid dispersion of the emitted pollutants. © 2017",-,Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\Department of Chemical Engineering\Greece; School for Advanced Study (IUSS)\Piazzale della Vittoria 15\Italy; Cyprus International Institute for Environmental and Public Health in Association with Harvard School of Public Health\Cyprus University of Technology\Cyprus; E.R.L.\Institute of Nuclear and Radiological Sciences and Technology\Greece,-,Air quality indices; Air quality monitoring; Cable bridge; PM source apportionment

809.html,Firm's default — new methodological approach and preliminary evidence from Poland,"Research background:Bankruptcy literature is populated with scores of (econometric) models ranging from Altman’s Z-score, Ohlson’s O-score, Zmijewski’s probit model to k-nearest neighbors, classification trees, support vector machines, mathematical programming, evolutionary algorithms or neural networks, all designed to predict financial distress with highest precision. We believe corporate default is too an important research topic to be identified with the prediction accuracy only. Despite the wealth of modelling effort, a unified theory of default is yet to be proposed. Purpose of the article: Due to the disagreement both on the definition and hence the timing of default, as well as on the measurement of prediction accuracy, the comparison (of predictive power) of various models can be seriously misleading. The purpose of the article is to argue for the shift in research focus from maximizing accuracy to the analysis of the information capacity of predictors. By doing this, we may yet come closer to understanding default itself. Methods: We critically appraise the bankruptcy research literature for its methodological variety and empirical findings. Default definitions, sampling procedures, in and out-of-sample testing and accuracy measurement are all scrutinized. In an empirical part, we use a double stochastic Poisson process with multi-period prediction horizon and a comprehen-sive database of some 15,000 Polish non-listed companies to illustrate the merits of our new approach to default modelling. Findings & Value added: In the theoretical part, we call for the construction of a single unified default forecasting platform estimated for the largest dataset of firms possible to allow testing the utility of various sources of micro, mezzo, and macro information. Our preliminary empirical evidence is encouraging. The accuracy ratio amounts to 0.92 for t = 0 and drops to 0.81 two years ahead of default. We point to the pivotal role played by the information on firm’s liquidity (alternatively in profitability) and — in contrast to Altman’s tradition — hardly any contribution to predictive power of other financial ratios. Macro data is shown to be critical. It adds, on average, more than 10 p.p. to accuracy ratio. In the fu-ture, we hope to integrate listed and non-listed firms data into one model, ideally at higher frequency than annual, and include the information on firm's competitiveness position. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

81.html,The landscape model: A model for exploring trade-offs between agricultural production and the environment,"We describe a model framework that simulates spatial and temporal interactions in agricultural landscapes and that can be used to explore trade-offs between production and environment so helping to determine solutions to the problems of sustainable food production. Here we focus on models of agricultural production, water movement and nutrient flow in a landscape. We validate these models against data from two long-term experiments, (the first a continuous wheat experiment and the other a permanent grass-land experiment) and an experiment where water and nutrient flow are measured from isolated catchments. The model simulated wheat yield (RMSE 20.3–28.6%), grain N (RMSE 21.3–42.5%) and P (RMSE 20.2–29% excluding the nil N plots), and total soil organic carbon particularly well (RMSE 3.1 − 13.8 %), the simulations of water flow were also reasonable (RMSE 180.36 and 226.02%).

810.html,Growth Inhibition and DNA Damage Induced by X-Phenols in Yeast: A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Study,"Phenolic compounds and their derivatives are ubiquitous constituents of numerous synthetic and natural chemicals that exist in the environment. Their toxicity is mostly attributed to their hydrophobicity and/or the formation of free radicals. In a continuation of the study of phenolic toxicity in a systematic manner, we have examined the biological responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a series of mostly monosubstituted phenols utilizing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach. The biological end points included a growth assay that determines the levels of growth inhibition induced by the phenols as well as a yeast deletion (DEL) assay that assesses the ability of X-phenols to induce DNA damage or DNA breaks. The QSAR analysis of cell growth patterns determined by IC50and IC80values indicates that toxicity is delineated by a hydrophobic, parabolic model. The DEL assay was then utilized to detect genomic deletions in yeast. The increase in the genotoxicity was enhanced by the electrophilicity of the phenolic substituents that were strong electron donors as well as by minimal hydrophobicity. The electrophilicities are represented by Brown's sigma plus values that are a variant of the Hammett sigma constants. A few mutant strains of genes involved in DNA repair were separately exposed to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol (BHT) and butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA). They were subsequently screened for growth phenotypes. BHA-induced growth defects in most of the DNA repair null mutant strains, whereas BHT was unresponsive. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Negritto M.

811.html,Heterogeneous Route for the One-Pot Synthesis of N-Arylamides from Aldoximes and Aryl Halides Using the CuO/Carbon Material,"Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by porous carbon materials (PCMs) are very promising for catalysis. In this work, monodispersed small and stable copper oxide (CuO) NPs were prepared with an average size of 10-20 nm without using any capping agent and then these NPs were encapsulated into porous carbon. The chemical and structural properties of the CuO/PCM material were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption. The obtained CuO/PCM nanocatalytic system has been used for the synthesis of N-arylamides from the reaction of aldoximes and aryl halides. Generally, copper(II) salt was used for the preparation of amides from aldoximes using some ligands and bases, but harsh reaction condition, stoichiometric amount of metal, and lack of recyclability limit their applications in industry. An alternative method is the use of heterogeneous catalysts. More importantly, these heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recycled and reused, showing potential application in organic synthesis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Islam Md.

82.html,Does the developmental stage and composition of riparian forest stand affect ecosystem functioning in streams?,"A common watershed restoration practice to improve water quality and stream ecosystem functions and services is replanting riparian corridors with plant species that may differ from those of natural communities. This restoration practice may have consequences on the aquatic ecosystem processes because organisms obtain energy from leaf litter inputs of the riparian zones. Leaf litter decomposition in streams is a vital ecosystem-level process, which depends on the activity of microorganisms and invertebrates. In the current study, we examined whether the type and developmental stage of riparian forest affect stream ecosystem functioning. We selected three widespread tree species in the Northwest Portugal, namely alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and conducted stream litter decomposition experiments with leaf litter from trees differing in developmental stage to assess leaf mass loss, fungal and invertebrate biomass and diversity. Both type and developmental stage of riparian stand significantly affected leaf mass loss, biomass of fungi and benthic invertebrates, sporulation of fungi, and abundance of invertebrates. However, only developmental stage of the riparian stand had an impact on the richness and diversity of fungi, whereas invertebrate diversity and richness was influenced by both stage and type classes. Overall our study provides the novel information that stream ecosystem processes are dictated not only by the composition but also by the developmental stage of the riparian stand. Moreover, this study provides an insight into how by altering riparian forest community composition through restoration practices may have an impact on a key ecosystem process and may have implications for successfully implementing future management strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Seena Sahadevan; Carvalho Francisco; Cássio Fernanda; Pascoal Cláudia,CBMA — Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology\Department of Biology\Portugal; MARE-Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre\Department of Life Sciences\Portugal; IB-S\Institute of Science and Innovation for Bio-Sustainability\Portugal,-,Aquatic hyphomycetes; Benthic invertebrates; Mature and juvenile trees; Riparian forest

Here, we have obtained the equilibrium geometry for certain PTCDI derivatives and calculated their occupied and unoccupied density of states separately for molecular orbitals lying in-plane (σ type) and orthogonal to the plane (π type) of the molecules. We have also simulated the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra for these molecules separately for π- and σ-type orbitals. A comparison between the unoccupied density of states and XAS data has been made because both provide a description of the molecular orbitals above the Fermi level. We have observed the presence of shallow-lying σ orbitals in twisted molecules and have obtained an almost linear relationship between the abundance of these orbitals and the degree of molecular twist. Additionally, we have shown the possibility of an experimentally viable stereoisomerism in PTCDI-C3. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Mukherjee Binayak; Mukherjee Manabendra,Department of Physics\Baba Farid Institute of Technology\India; Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics\1/AF\India; Department of Physics\B.

We constructed a new selective fluorescent sensor for UO22+, Sm3+, and Eu3+based on a carbon dot (C-dot)-aerogel hybrid prepared through in situ carbonization of 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), a high-affinity heavy metal chelator. The TTA-C-dot-aerogel enabled the detection of UO22+ions, which induced a significant red fluorescence shift, whereas Eu3+and particularly Sm3+ions gave rise to pronounced fluorescence quenching. Importantly, the lanthanide/actinide ion-selective TTA-C-dots could be synthesized only in situ inside the aerogel pores, indicating the crucial role of the aerogel host matrix both in enabling the formation of the C-dots and in promoting the adsorption and interactions of the lanthanide and actinide metal ions with the embedded C-dots. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Dolai Susmita; Bhunia Susanta Kumar; Zeiri Leila; Paz-Tal Ofra; Jelinek Raz,Department of Chemistry\Ben Gurion University of the Negev\Israel; Ilse Katz Institute for Nanotechnology\Ben Gurion University of the Negev\Israel; Chemistry Department\Nuclear Research Center\Israel; Schulich Faculty of Chemistry\Technion-Israel Institute of Technology\Israel,-,-
825.html,Oxytocin-Monolayer-Based Impedimetric Biosensor for Zinc and Copper Ions,"Zinc and copper are essential metal ions for numerous biological processes. Their levels are tightly maintained in all body organs. Impairment of the Zn2+to Cu2+ratio in serum was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological and inflammatory disorders. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide, and its activity is modulated by zinc and copper ion binding. Harnessing the intrinsic properties of OT is one of the attractive ways to develop valuable metal ion sensors. Here, we report for the first time an OT-based metal ion sensor prepared by immobilizing the neuropeptide onto a glassy carbon electrode. The developed impedimetric biosensor was ultrasensitive to Zn2+and Cu2+ions at physiological pH and not to other biologically relevant ions. Interestingly, the electrochemical impedance signal of two hemicircle systems was recorded after the attachment of OT to the surface. These two semicircles suggest two capacitive regions that result from two different domains in the OT monolayer. Moreover, the change in the charge-transfer resistance of either Zn2+or Cu2+was not similar in response to binding. This suggests that the metal-dependent conformational changes of OT can be translated to distinct impedimetric data. Selective masking of Zn2+and Cu2+was used to allow for the simultaneous determination of zinc to copper ions ratio by the OT sensor. The OT sensor was able to distinguish between healthy control and multiple sclerosis patients diluted sera samples by determining the Zn/Cu ratio similar to the state-of-the-art techniques.

827.html,Graphene-Coupled ZnO: A Robust NIR-Induced Catalyst for Rapid Photo-Oxidation of Cyanide,"Herein, we report the modulation of ZnO for enhancement of its ability toward plasmonic absorption of near-infrared (NIR) photons through coupling of graphene (GR). The reported modification led GR-ZnO to be a promising photocatalyst by the complete removal of poisonous and nonvolatile potassium cyanide from water. The photocatalytic degradation of cyanide was revealed by exposing it to NIR laser and comparing with the rate of UV, visible, and sunlight using their apparent reaction rate constants derived from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The heteronanostructured GR-ZnO promoted rapid photo-oxidation of cyanide under illumination with NIR laser rather than UV, visible, and sunlight. It was assessed that the photothermal effect (PTE) is the main cause for higher catalytic efficiency of GR-ZnO in the presence of NIR radiations. Except for the NIR radiations, GR-ZnO does not show any indication of PTE by irradiating with UV, visible, or sunlight. On account of its significance, the PTE of GR-ZnO in KCN solution was evaluated and compared with its individual components viz., GR and ZnO upon exposure to a 980 nm laser system. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the PTE of GR-ZnO was proportional to its concentration. In addition to its effectiveness in the degradation of cyanide, GR-ZnO retained its special structure and exhibited an outstanding photostability after its repeated use in three successive cycles. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Neelgund Gururaj M.; Oki Aderemi,Department of Chemistry\Prairie View A and M University\United States,-,-
828.html,"“Not for Erich Honecker back then, nor for Angela Merkel Today, but for your own sake” – A Case Study About Voluntary Activity in Rural Areas Caught Between Socio-Political Claims and Individual Perceptions","For several years now, volunteer activity has been increasingly placed at the center of a political discourse mo-nopolizing it for politics of dealing with socio-and spatio-political problems. It is particularly in those rural regions affected by out-migration and an ageing population that vol-unteering is considered an advisable way for securing local public responsibilities. Based on a critical reflection and discussion of these political positions we plead for a sub-ject-oriented research approach in order to understand re-gionally problematised conditions not primarily as static parameters, but as individually negotiated aspects of everyday life. Accordingly, voluntary activity is investigated in terms of individually perceived challenges and underlying logics of action as a social practice of collaboratively or-ganising everyday life in a shrinking rural region. Hence, using a case study conducted in the Altenburger Land in Thuringia we analyse the socially embedded negotiation of responsibilities between municipal actors and voluntary workers on the one hand and trace the influencing factors on voluntary activities considered relevant by involved actors on the other hand. Those factors include institutional and political support, municipality reforms, regional education and working conditions in the light of a problematic regional labour market, for example. Building on the results of our empirical research we finally discuss the political and analytical-conceptual implications resulting from the notion of a homogeneous community of voluntary workers and their political-strategic invocation and activation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",Schwarzenberg Tom; Miggelbrink Judith; Meyer Frank,Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde\Schongauerstraße 9\Germany,-,Civic engagement; Peripheralisation; Rural regions; Shrinkage; Social practice; Subject; Voluntary activity
829.html,Evolution of Calcite Nanocrystals through Oriented Attachment and Fragmentation: Multistep Pathway Involving Bottom-Up and Break-Down Stages,A nonclassical multistep pathway involving bottom-up and break-down stages for the evolution of calcite nanograins ∼50 nm in size was demonstrated in a basic aqueous system. Calcite nanofibrils ∼10 nm wide were produced as the initial crystalline phase via amorphous calcium carbonate through ion-by-ion assembly by the carbonation of Ca(OH)2at a high pH of ∼13. Bundles ∼50 nm in diameter were then formed by the subsequent oriented attachment of the nanofibrils. Monodispersed calcite nanograins were finally obtained through spontaneous fragmentation of the fibrous forms via a decrease in pH by further carbonation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.,Takasaki Mihiro; Kezuka Yuki; Tajika Masahiko; Oaki Yuya; Imai Hiroaki,Department of Applied Chemistry\Faculty of Science and Technology\Japan; Shiraishi Central Laboratories Co.

83.html,"Variability, drivers, and effects of atmospheric nitrogen inputs across an urban area: Emerging patterns among human activities, the atmosphere, and soils","Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) is a major input of N to the biosphere and is elevated beyond preindustrial levels throughout many ecosystems. Deposition monitoring networks in the United States generally avoid urban areas in order to capture regional patterns of N deposition, and studies measuring N deposition in cities usually include only one or two urban sites in an urban-rural comparison or as an anchor along an urban-to-rural gradient. Describing patterns and drivers of atmospheric N inputs is crucial for understanding the effects of N deposition; however, little is known about the variability and drivers of atmospheric N inputs or their effects on soil biogeochemistry within urban ecosystems. We measured rates of canopy throughfall N as a measure of atmospheric N inputs, as well as soil net N mineralization and nitrification, soil solution N, and soil respiration at 15 sites across the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. Rates of throughfall N are 8.70 ± 0.68 kg N ha− 1yr− 1, vary 3.5-fold across sites, and are positively correlated with rates of local vehicle N emissions. Ammonium (NH4+) composes 69.9 ± 2.2% of inorganic throughfall N inputs and is highest in late spring, suggesting a contribution from local fertilizer inputs. Soil solution NO3−is positively correlated with throughfall NO3−inputs. In contrast, soil solution NH4+, net N mineralization, nitrification, and soil respiration are not correlated with rates of throughfall N inputs. Rather, these processes are correlated with soil properties such as soil organic matter. Our results demonstrate high variability in rates of urban throughfall N inputs, correlation of throughfall N inputs with local vehicle N emissions, and a decoupling of urban soil biogeochemistry and throughfall N inputs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Decina Stephen M.; Templer Pamela H.; Hutyra Lucy R.; Gately Conor K.; Rao Preeti,Department of Biology\Boston University\United States; Department of Earth and Environment\Boston University\United States; Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences\Harvard University\United States; School of Natural Resources and Environment\University of Michigan\United States,-,Atmospheric deposition; Nitrogen cycle; Soil nutrient cycling; Soil respiration; Urban biogeochemistry; Vehicle NOxand NH3emissions
830.html,The impact of global risk on the performance of socially responsible and conventional stock indices,"Research background:In the last decades social responsible investment has evolved into an important and influential investment class. What supports then the development of SRI? The neoclassical approach suggests that the attractiveness of investment should result from the risk-return relationship that is satisfying for the investor. However, the performance analysis of SRI vs. conventional investment, conducted in numerous research papers, often delivers contradictory conclusions. If financial factors could not explain the phenomenon of SRI, nonfinancial factors may have played a decisive role in the formation of modern SRI market. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to analyze financial investment performance of socially responsible vs. respective conventional indices in the periods of high, low and unidentified global risk. Therefore, a following research hypothesis was verified: SR indices perform financially better in high-risk periods than in low-risk periods. This hypothesis is justified by the assumption that, when selecting SRI, investors go by a longer investment horizon than they do when selecting other investments, not subject to such verification. Methods: Among SR indices, we chose three to compare them with their conventional counterparts: DJSI US vs. DJITR (USA), DJSI Korea vs. KOSPI (South Korea) and Respect Index vs. WIG20TR (Poland). The VIX index was used as the global measure of risk aversion. To measure the relative performance of SR and conventional indices in different risk periods, we applied risk-adjusted performance measures, including RSD, Sharpe and Treynor ratios, traditional and asymmetrical CAPM. Findings & Value added: The research shows that conventional and socially responsible indices do not differ statistically in terms of risk and return irrespective of global risk. Our research confirms that the rising, socially responsible, investment market cannot be analyzed only through the prism of simplified rational choices. Additionally, it should be analyzed in terms of moral philosophy and behavioral economics, including the psycho-social features of investors. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

This sensor 1 exhibited obvious luminesce quenching by hydrogen bond interactions with F-. In addition, the resulting 1-F complex can be further used to detect Al3+through a luminesce enhancement. The detection limit (0.02 μM) of 1-F for Al3+is far lower than the World Health Organization (7.41 μM) limit for drinking water. Importantly, chemosensor 1-F could be used to detect and quantify F-and Al3+reversibly.

832.html,"Early Permian (Asselian-Sakmarian) palynoflora from Chintalapudi area, Godavari Graben, South India and its palaeoenvironmental implications","This article integrates palynological, palaeobotanical and palynofacies analysis to evaluate the stratigraphy, palaeovegetation and palaeoenvironment of the deposited sediments. The palynological investigation has been done in the 100m terrestrially derived sedimentary succession of bore core MCP-9, Chintalapudi area, located on the western margin of Chintalapudi Sub-basin. The quantitative and qualitative analysis indicates a rich palynofloral assemblage dominated by gymnosperm pollens, chiefly radial monosaccates, viz. Parasaccites and Plicatipollenites. Parasaccites dominates over Plicatipollenites. Based on the recovered palynoflora, Parasaccites + Plicatipollenites Assemblage zone is framed which corresponds to the upper Talchir palynological assemblage of the Gondwana succession. On the basis of palynocomposition of the assemblage and its correlation with the early Permian palynoflora of India and other Gondwana continents, an early Permian (late Asselian-early Sakmarian) age has been assigned to the studied succession. The palynofacies studies for the Talchir deposits in the Chintalapudi Sub-basin have also been attempted to interpret the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the deposition of these sediments. The organic matter analysis represent swamp dominated conditions under two different sedimentary environments (Palynofacies-I and II). Palynofacies-I is dominated by degraded organic matter and represents low energy, dysoxic to anoxic environmental conditions. Palynofacies-II is characterized by the dominance of palynomorphs representing low energy, anoxic, water-logged environmental conditions. The recovered palynofacies represent dominance of Cordaites monosaccate pollen (Parasaccites, Plicatipollenites) along with occasionally growing pteridophytic plant spores indicating colder climatic conditions with intermittent spells of cooler (slightly warmer) and humid environments. © 2017 Palaeontological Society Of India.

834.html,Woodland rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation in an agricultural landscape in South Eastern Australia,"Southern Australia has a tree crisis. The iconic and ecologically essential eucalypt trees are dying out across vast swathes of farmland that were once grassy woodlands. A century of clearing and agricultural intensification, plus the failure of these trees to self-regenerate, has led to a massive loss of wildlife habitat, particularly tree hollows that only form in large and old Eucalyptus trees. Just as importantly, this decline in trees has exposed farmers to losses of agricultural productivity. There is now a lack of shelter for livestock. Rising salty ground water is degrading pastures as this ground water is no longer being controlled by the deep roots and respiration of eucalypts. We describe the research that shows how an innovative partnership between farmers, a non-government environmental organisation, and government funding is rehabilitating entire fields to a productive and wildlife-rich woodland full of thriving eucalypts. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.",Adams-Schimminger Miriam; Fifield Graham; Doran Bruce; Freudenberger David,Fenner School of Environment and Society\Australian National University\Australia; Greening Australia\Jamison\Australia,-,-

84.html,Evaluation of EDAR vehicle emissions remote sensing technology,"Despite much work in recent years, vehicle emissions remain a significant contributor in many areas where air quality standards are under threat. Policy-makers are actively exploring options for next generation vehicle emission control and local fleet management policies, and new monitoring technologies to aid these activities. Therefore, we report here on findings from two separate but complementary blind evaluation studies of one new-to-market real-world monitoring option, HEAT LLC's Emission Detection And Reporting system or EDAR, an above-road open path instrument that uses Differential Absorption LIDAR to provide a highly sensitive and selective measure of passing vehicle emissions. The first study, by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Eastern Research Group, was a simulated exhaust gas test exercise used to investigate the instrumental accuracy of the EDAR. Here, CO, NO, CH4and C3H8measurements were found to exhibit high linearity, low bias, and low drift over a wide range of concentrations and vehicle speeds. Instrument accuracy was high (R20.996 for CO, 0.998 for NO; 0.983 for CH4; and 0.976 for C3H8) and detection limits were 50 to 100 ppm for CO, 10 to 30 ppm for NO, 15 to 35 ppmC for CH4, and, depending on vehicle speed, 100 to 400 ppmC3for C3H8. The second study, by the Universities of Birmingham and Leeds and King's College London, used the comparison of EDAR, on-board Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) and car chaser (SNIFFER) system measurements collected under real-world conditions to investigate in situ EDAR performance. Given the analytical challenges associated with aligning these very different measurements, the observed agreements (e.g. EDAR versus PEMS R20.92 for CO/CO2; 0.97 for NO/CO2; ca. 0.82 for NO2/CO2; and, 0.94 for PM/CO2) were all highly encouraging and indicate that EDAR also provides a representative measure of vehicle emissions under real-world conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ropkins Karl; DeFries Timothy H.; Pope Francis; Green David C.; Kemper Jim; Kishan Sandeep; Fuller Gary W.; Li Hu; Sidebottom Jim; Crilley Leigh R.; Kramer Louisa; Bloss William J.,Institute for Transport Studies\Faculty of Environment\United Kingdom; Eastern Research Group Inc\3508 Far West Boulevard\United States; School of Geography\Earth and Environmental Sciences\United Kingdom; Analytical & Environmental Sciences Division\King's College London\United Kingdom,-,Car chaser; EDAR; PEMS; Remote sensing; SNIFFER; Vehicle emissions; VERSS

The experiment was conducted in São João do Triunfo, PR, using randomized blocks with three treatments (control - A, root removal - B and base cut - C) and five replications. Number of seedlings, saplings and small trees were recorded at the beginning, 60, 120 and 180 days after treatment. A high number of seedlings were observed, but over time mortality became evident regardless of treatment. Root removal reduced the number of seedlings when compared to base cut. Root removal differed statistically from the control and base cut treatments. Base cut did not differ statistically from the control. Root system plays an important role in survival and regrowth of juveniles of the target species. Root removal prevents regrowth and survival based on natural regeneration. By its attributes, this species may be considered a relevant alien invasive tree in the Araucaria Forest. © 2017 Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

Individuals of C. praecincta were recorded inside 1800 m2of interior forest area. Caudex height was measured in order to classify specimens into length classes and relate this variable with fertility of individuals. Ninety-eight individuals were sampled, featuring a low population density (5.4 individuals per 100 m-2) when compared to other tree fern populations. The spatial distribution was clustered (Ia = 2.12; p = 0.0002) and the length class distribution followed an exponential or reverse J-shaped pattern. The high number of individuals classified in the smaller length class (0 to 0.25 m) may be an indication that the studied population is under expansion. This endorses the need for conservation of the study area and for reducing the risk of local extinction by disturbances. © 2017 Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

85.html,The profound effect of harmful cyanobacterial blooms: From food-web and management perspectives,"Sustainable and effective water management plans must have a reliable risk assessment strategies for harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HABs) that would enable timely decisions to be made, thus avoiding the trespassing of ecological thresholds, leading to the collapse of ecosystem structure and function. Such strategies are usually based on cyanobacterial biomass and/or on the monitoring of known toxins, which may, however, in many cases, under- or over-represent the actual toxicity of the HAB. Therefore, in this study, by the application of growth-inhibition assays using different bacteria, algae, zooplankton and fish species, we assessed the toxicological potential of two cyanobacterial blooms that differed in total cyanobacterial biomass, species composition and cyanopeptide profiles. We demonstrated that neither cyanobacterial community composition nor its relative abundance, nor indeed concentrations of known toxins reflected the potential risk of HAB based on growth-inhibition assays. We discuss our findings in the context of food-web dynamics and ecosystem management, and suggest that toxicological tests should constitute a key element in the routine monitoring of water bodies so as to prevent under-/over-estimation of potential HAB risk for both ecosystem and public health. © 2017",Šulčius Sigitas; Montvydienė Danguolė; Mazur-Marzec Hanna; Kasperovičienė Jūratė; Rulevičius Rokas; Cibulskaitė Živilė,Laboratory of Algology and Microbial Ecology\Nature Research Centre\Lithuania; Department of Marine Biotechnology\Institute of Oceanography\Poland; Laboratory of Ecology and Physiology of Hydrobionts\Verkių str. 98\Lithuania,-,Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; Baltic Sea; Curonian Lagoon; Cyanotoxins; Recreational waters
850.html,Economic growth and disparities: An empirical analysis for the central and eastern European countries,"Research background:The processes of economic convergence observed in many developing countries are characterized by reduction of economic differences on the cross-country level, which are accompanied by growing internal economic inequalities. This may stem from the fact that in the catching-up countries, a more dynamic growth pattern is observed in the economically strongest regions, which is initially reflected in spatial polarization and increasing regional inequalities. However, just as the countries reach higher levels of development, the diffusion of growth-inducing impulses to less-developed areas should lead to the spatial equalizing of the development levels and reducing regional inequalities. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to determine the relationship between the level of economic growth and observed economic inequalities in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The theoretical framework adopted to describe and explain those relations is the so-called Williamson’s hypothesis in which the relationship between the scale of regional inequalities and economic growth is illustrated by a curve shaped like an inverted U. Methods: The research procedure was intended to verify Williamson’s hypothesis by estimating parabolic econometric models. Indicators of economic growth along with measure of regional inequalities (Williamson’s coefficient of variation) were used in the regression modeling. The research period spanned the years 1995-2014. Findings & Value added: In the light of the study of CEE countries, it was possible to observe both convergence symptoms as well as divergence tendencies. It can be thus stated that the analyzed CEE countries followed a similar path to the one observed earlier by Williamson in other developing countries. However, the analyses conducted by the authors at the national and regional levels of CEE countries were equivocal and did not fully support the theoretical assumptions of Williamson’s hypothesis. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

This is why its measurement has been considered as the greatest weight indicator for defining consumer preferences and expectations. The objective of this article is to evaluate the relationship among the satisfaction levels of hotel service consumers in Colombia, their gender, place of origin and the connotation of the reviews made online as a result of hotel ethical behaviour. The applied methodology uses the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to validate the relations between the variables. A regression model is run to better understand the causal relations. Clusters are analyzed under the biphasic cluster procedure and a previously validated ethical behaviour scale is used to classify negative comments. Messages from 356 consumers on the Booking.com platform were analyzed. The results highlight that the place of origin and the comments made online have a significant impact on customer satisfaction. In addition, the level of ethical behaviour of hotels is affected mainly by the expectations about room, price and service provided by hotel employees. © 2017. ASERS Publishing.

This far, a tourism development policy has not been able to maximally promote the economic growth through regulation as outlined in the development plan, based on the stages of the preparation of the agenda, the formulation, the adoption, the implementation and the evaluation. This study used regression analysis with Amos towards 400 samples. Whilst the method used was the qualitative method. The implementation of the results derived from the five variables always yields the negative results below 0.05, i.e. -0.29 on the link between variables, -0.361 on the link between the parameters of indicators, and -0.187 on the partial link. Whilst the total link between the evaluation variables of the economic growth was not significant, which means that the implementation of tourism policy in order to promote the economic growth by means of the approach of cultural tourism and nature tourism was inconsistent with the preparation of the policy agenda, the adoption, the formulation and the evaluation. This study concluded that a review is needed to be done, hence the implementation could properly materialize, such as the placement of people in a proper place, followed by the improvement of the policy evaluation on the whole. © 2017.

Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and sulfadiazine are the four dominant antibiotics in this region, with maximum and median concentrations of 1454.8 and 304.8 ng/L, 2796.6 and 161.9 ng/L, 1431.3 and 349.9 ng/L, and 499.5 and 106.5 ng/L, respectively. The median concentrations of the other nine antibiotics are lower than 57.1 ng/L. The highest contaminated sites are located in the Four-lake main canal and its lake inlets. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in November than in May and the concentrations were strongly correlated with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrates according to redundancy analysis. The source analysis indicated that besides untreated domestic and husbandry sewage, the aquaculture in the lake and ponds is a main source of antibiotics in the study region. The environmental hazards posed by the selected antibiotics were assessed by using the methods of hazard quotient and mixture hazard quotient. The results suggested that tetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, and ciprofloxacin pose medium to high ecological hazard to algae in almost all of the water samples, and the high combination ecological hazards of antibiotics are mainly posed by the high individual hazard quotient of tetracycline in the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Zhi; Du Yun; Yang Chao; Liu Xi; Zhang Junqian; Li Enhua; Zhang Qing; Wang Xuelei,Key Laboratory for Environment and Disaster Monitoring and Evaluation Hubei\Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics\China; The Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation\Institute of Hydrobiology\China,-,Aquaculture; Hazard evaluation; Pharmaceuticals; Pollution; Tetracycline

The solution method is an important technique for low-cost and large fabrication of oxide semiconductor TFTs. However, a key challenge of solution-processable ZnO TFTs is the relatively high processing temperature (≥500 °C) for achieving high carrier mobility. Here, facile, low-cost, and solution-processable ZnO TFTs were fabricated under the annealing temperature of ≤300 °C. Dense and polycrystalline ZnO films were deposited by the spin-coating method. The ZnO TFTs showed the maximum electron mobility of 11 cm2/V s and a high on/off ratio of >107when the ZnO thin films were annealed at 300 °C. The mobility was extremely high among solution-processable undoped ZnO TFTs reported previously, even better than some high-cost indium-doped ZnO TFTs fabricated at low temperature. Furthermore, it is found that the mechanism of oxygen vacancies dominates the electron transport in ZnO thin film and interface behaviors of ZnO thin film and SiO2gate insulator, and then dominates the performances of devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Jiang Li; Li Jinhua; Huang Kang; Li Shanshan; Wang Qiang; Sun Zhengguang; Mei Tao; Wang Jianying; Zhang Lei; Wang Ning; Wang Xianbao,Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Organic Chemical Materials\Key Laboratory for the Green Preparation and Application of Functional Materials\China; National Engineering Laboratory for Fiber Optic Sensing Technology\Wuhan University of Technology\China,-,-

Therefore, it is essential that the farmers must be aware of the harmful effects of pesticides. Aims and Objectives: To assess knowledge, practice and identify self-reported morbidity symptoms associated with pesticide use among farm women in the identified villages of Telangana, India. Materials and Methods: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted using a pre-tested questionnaire to carry out the survey among farmwomen. Results: 129 women working in agricultural farms were included in the study. Meagre knowledge regarding route of pesticide exposure was observed. Majority of them were not aware of toxicity symbols and never read the precautions on the pesticide containers. Inaccessibility was the main reason for insubstantial use of personal protective equipments (PPEs). Unsafe storage and disposal practices of containers were observed. Weakness (57.3%), headache (52%) and itching of skin (51.1%) were the common morbidity symptoms. Significant association was found between morbidity symptoms and use of PPE and hygienic practices, indicating importance of such practices. Conclusion: Improving knowledge which influences their practices and encouraging PPE use might be useful to remediate these issues.

With regard to sludge dewatering, surfactants can weaken the binding interaction between sludge flocs and promote the dissolution of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), resulting in the release of bound water. Using surfactants in anaerobic digestion promotes the release of enzymes trapped in sludge and improves the activity of enzymes during hydrolysis. Owing to their characteristic encapsulation of hydrophobes into self-assembled aggregates (micelles), surfactants can form host-guest complexes with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Additionally, surfactants can enhance the desorption of heavy metals and prevent the emergence of heavy metal residue. This review summarizes the current surfactant-based sludge treatment technologies according to their roles in sludge disposal solutions. Then, possible mechanisms of surfactants in sludge dewatering, anaerobic digestion, and the removal of organic pollutants and heavy metals are analysed systemically. Finally, changes to sludge treatment via the aid of surfactants are highlighted. This review presents the comprehensive advances in the use of surfactants in WAS reduction, recycling, and risk relief, underscoring their roles in increasing economic efficiency and ensuring environmental quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Guan Renpeng; Yuan Xingzhong; Wu Zhibin; Wang Hou; Jiang Longbo; Li Yifu; Zeng Guangming,College of Environmental Science and Engineering\Hunan University\China; Key Laboratory of Environment Biology and Pollution Control\Hunan University\China; School of Chemical & Biomedical Engineering\Nanyang Technological University\Singapore,-,Anaerobic digestion; Dewatering; Heavy metals; Organic pollutants; Surfactants; Waste-activated sludge

871.html,Burden of dermatological manifestations across various age groups of a hilly state in North India,"Background: The dermatological condition accounts for an important public health problem of the global load of disease in low and middle-income countries and places significant pressure on primary healthcare centers. There is heterogeneity in the frequency of diverse skin conditions between different areas (1). Most of the knowledge presently available about various aspects of skin diseases is based on observations made and data collected from secondary and tertiary level hospitals (2). Information on community-based prevalence and pattern of skin diseases would be a better measure of burden due to skin diseases in general population in order to assist in the planning of possible intervention strategies (3). Aims & Objectives: To find out the prevalence, distribution, and determinants of various dermatological manifestations at the community level in Doiwala block of district Dehradun. Material & Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 12 months, the study subjects comprised of individuals of all age groups. A sample size of 834 (416 males & 418 females) was calculated by using current prevalence of skin diseases (43.7% in males & 44.7% in females) in Uttarakhand (1). Results: Nearly half of the studied population (45.8%) had some type of dermatological manifestations. It was slightly higher in females (47.1%) than males (44.5%). Out of 382 symptomatic respondents, 247 (64.7) had infective dermatoses followed by 124 (32.5%) non-infective, 6 (1.5%) others and 5 (1.3%) nutritional deficiency dermatoses. The gender-wise distribution of various types of dermatoses was found to be statistically significant (χ2-15.225, df-3, p-0.002). Conclusions: The prevalence of dermatological conditions in district Dehradun is fairly high with increased prevalence in the younger age group that might be an indicator to the fact that the burden of skin diseases may go to rise in the future. © 2017, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

875.html,"Is eating organic a healthy or safer option? Health claims for organic food consumption, food quality and safety - A systematic review","Universally, there has been an increased awareness about the harmful effects of chemical inputs used for production of food on soil composition, environment and human health. This has triggered the consumption level of organic food products. India has witnessed a tremendous growth in domestic as well as export market. The demand is mainly driven by consumer perceptions that organic farming is more sustainable, produces healthy food, pesticide-free and safeguards the environment & biodiversity. Organic food producers also manifests the quality and safety of food. These claims which are perceived and professed as beneficial can only be accepted if they are tested and validated. Therefore, the foremost objective of this review paper is to provide an update on set of studies related to scientific evidence for nutritional composition marking the quality of organic foods vis-à-vis conventional foods and its impact on human health. Secondly, the paper examines the comparison of the sensory quality of the organic food, and thirdly the food safety aspect of organically as compared with conventionally grown foods. Past few controlled studies have proved that there is no such evidence of differences in concentration of various nutrients amongst organic and conventional foods. Furthermore, there are certain issues related to the impact and assessment of these nutrients in organic food which requires some future directives. Owing to the heterogeneity in results observed related to nutritional quality and safety of organic foods, technological aspects together with sensory parameters are the best for future comparative studies. To safeguard the public health and to avoid the difference in sampling and sample results, testing laboratories should also be adhering to uniform standards. Organic food business in India lack standard guidelines for quality, policy framework for domestic and export market. Also, traceability is another factor which should be given prime importance to ensure removal of fraudulent practices. © 2017, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

88.html,A modified SINTACS method for groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk assessment in highly anthropized regions based on NO3−and SO42−concentrations,"Groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment area worldwide tools in supporting groundwater protection and land planning. In this study, we used three of these different methodologies applied to the Campanian Plain located in southern Italy: SINTACS, AVI and LOS. However, their capability to describe the observed chemical pollution of the area has resulted quite poor. For such a reason, a modified SINTACS method has been then implemented in the area in order to get a more reliable view of groundwater vulnerability. NO3−and SO42 −from more than 400 monitoring wells were used for specific vulnerability assessment. Land use was chosen as key parameter to infer the risk of groundwater pollution in our area. The new methodology seems to show a higher correlation with observed NO3−concentrations and a more reliable identification of aquifer's pollution hot spots. The main sources of NO3−were found in sub-urban areas, where vulnerability and risk are higher than in other areas. Otherwise due to reducing conditions triggered by the presence of elevated sedimentary organic matter and peat, concentrations below agricultural areas were lower than in sub-urban areas. The SO42 −specific vulnerability map showed a positive correlation with observed concentrations, due to geogenic and anthropogenic SO42 −sources present in the area. The combination of both NO3−and SO42 −derived risk maps becomes essential to improve the conceptual model of aquifer pollution in this severely anthropized area. The application of this new and original approach shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the described previous methods and clearly showed how anthropogenic activities have to be taken into account in the assessment process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Busico Gianluigi; Kazakis Nerantzis; Colombani Nicolò; Mastrocicco Micòl; Voudouris Konstantinos; Tedesco Dario,Department of Environmental\Biological and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies\Italy; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\Department of Geology\Greece; Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology\University of Ferrara\Italy,-,Anthropized territory; Classification methods; Groundwater quality; Porous aquifer; Specific vulnerability

Considering the biological relevance of arginine and lysine, significant efforts have been directed to develop fluorescent sensors for their detection. However, these developed sensors suffer from certain disadvantages such as poor aqueous solubility, technically demanding and time-consuming synthetic protocols, and more importantly, most of them operate through single wavelength measurements, making their performance prone to small variations in experimental conditions. Herein, we report a ratiometric sensor that operates through lysine- and arginine-induced dissociation of a supramolecular assembly consisting of emissive H-aggregates of a molecular rotor dye, thioflavin-T (ThT), on the surface of a polyanionic supramolecular host, sulfated β-cyclodextrin. This disassembly brings out the modulation of monomer-aggregate equilibrium in the system which acts as an ideal scheme for the ratiometric detection of lysine and arginine in the aqueous solution. Besides facile framework of our sensor system, it employs a commercially available inexpensive probe molecule, ThT, which provides an added advantage over other sensor systems that employ synthetically demanding probe molecules. Importantly, the distinctive feature of the ratiometric detection of arginine and lysine provides an inherent advantage of increased accuracy in quantitative analysis. Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that arginine displays a multiwavelength distinctive recognition pattern which distinguishes it from lysine, using a single supramolecular ensemble. Furthermore, our sensor system also shows response in heterogeneous, biologically complex media of serum samples, thus extending its possible use in real-life applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Pettiwala Aafrin M.; Singh Prabhat K.,Radiation and Photochemistry Division\Bhabha Atomic Research Centre\India; Homi Bhabha National Institute\Training School Complex\India,-,-

889.html,Monodispersed Ru Nanoparticles Functionalized Graphene Nanosheets as Efficient Cathode Catalysts for O2-Assisted Li-CO2Battery,"In Li-CO2battery, due to the highly insulating nature of the discharge product of Li2CO3, the battery needs to be charged at a high charge overpotential, leading to severe cathode and electrolyte instability and hence poor battery cycle performance. Developing efficient cathode catalysts to effectively reduce the charge overpotential represents one of key challenges to realize practical Li-CO2batteries. Here, we report the use of monodispersed Ru nanoparticles functionalized graphene nanosheets as cathode catalysts in Li-CO2battery to significantly lower the charge overpotential for the electrochemical decomposition of Li2CO3. In our battery, a low charge voltage of 4.02 V, a high Coulomb efficiency of 89.2%, and a good cycle stability (67 cycles at a 500 mA h/g limited capacity) are achieved. It is also found that O2plays an essential role in the discharge process of the rechargeable Li-CO2battery. Under the pure CO2environment, Li-CO2battery exhibits negligible discharge capacity; however, after introducing 2% O2(volume ratio) into CO2, the O2-assisted Li-CO2battery can deliver a high capacity of 4742 mA h/g. Through an in situ quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometry investigation, the final discharge product Li2CO3is proposed to form via the reaction 4Li++ 2CO2+ O2+ 4e-→ 2Li2CO3. Our results validate the essential role of O2and can help deepen the understanding of the discharge and charge reaction mechanisms of the Li-CO2battery. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Wang Liangjun; Dai Wenrui; Ma Lipo; Gong Lili; Lyu Zhiyang; Zhou Yin; Liu Jia; Lin Ming; Lai Min; Peng Zhangquan; Chen Wei,School of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering\Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology\China; Department of Physics\National University of Singapore\Singapore; Department of Chemistry\National University of Singapore\Singapore; State Key Laboratory of Electroanalytical Chemistry\Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry\China,-,-

These copper species in Cu-CNK-OH are embedded in the frame of CNK-OH mostly via the Cu-N bonds. Cu-CNK-OH has been employed as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst to degrade rhodamine B (RhB). Both the production efficiency of hydroxyl radicals and the transformation rate of Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox pair increase under visible-light irradiation. As a result, Cu-CNK-OH exhibits improved Fenton-like catalytic activity on the degradation of RhB. The synergetic interaction between Fenton-like process and photocatalytic process also contributes such improvement. The hydroxyl radicals and holes are the major reactive species in the photocatalytically assisted Fenton-like process. This study provides a valuable strategy for metal modification of alkalinized g-C3N4with enhanced Fenton-like catalytic performance for the degradation of organic contaminants.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dong Qimei; Chen Yingying; Wang Lingli; Ai Shasha; Ding Hanming,School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering\East China Normal University\China,-,Alkalization; Copper modification; Degradation; Graphitic carbon nitride; Photocatalytically assisted Fenton-like process
890.html,System identification through online sparse Gaussian process regression with input noise,"There has been a growing interest in using non-parametric regression methods like Gaussian Process (GP) regression for system identification. GP regression does traditionally have three important downsides: (1) it is computationally intensive, (2) it cannot efficiently implement newly obtained measurements online, and (3) it cannot deal with stochastic (noisy) input points. In this paper we present an algorithm tackling all these three issues simultaneously. The resulting Sparse Online Noisy Input GP (SONIG) regression algorithm can incorporate new noisy measurements in constant runtime. A comparison has shown that it is more accurate than similar existing regression algorithms. When applied to nonlinear black-box system modeling, its performance is competitive with existing nonlinear ARX models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bijl Hildo; Schön Thomas B.; van Wingerden Jan-Willem; Verhaegen Michel,Delft Center for Systems and Control\Delft University of Technology\Netherlands; Department of Information Technology\Uppsala University\Sweden,-,Gaussian processes; Machine learning; Nonlinear system identification; Regression; Sparse methods

Therefore, voltage-endurance tests and electric field simulation calculations are conducted against UHV Y-shape, V-shape, and I-shape insulator strings, and recommended a new type of Y-shape insulator string structure which is applicable to China's UHVAC transmission lines and insulation design.Test results indicate that, firstly,the relationship between U50%and salt deposition density is nonlinear and negatively exponentially decreases when the SDD is set as 0.1 mg/cm2, 0.15 mg/cm2, 0.25 mg/cm2and NSDD as 1.0 mg/cm2;secondly, the U50%value of Y-shape insulator string is 20.1% lower than that of I-shape insulator string, the parameter A is 95.3, and α is 0.11. The obtained results can be used for string design of the new type of UHV Y-shape insulator string to improve the insulation properties of insulator string, and realize gradual application and popularization of the new insulator string in the follow-up UHV engineering. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

We used micro level noble catalysts (Au,Ag and Pt, weight loadings 0.1×10-6~10×10-6) installed in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor to decompose benzene in stimulated air.Moreover, we characterized the benzene composition under different noble catalyst loadings, various reaction temperatures, and various energy densities,and discussed the mechanism of benzene decomposition. Experimental results show that: 1) Benzene removal rates in the DBD reactors with noble metal catalysts will significantly increase compared with the DBD reactor in the absence of a catalyst. 2) At a fixed reaction temperature of 25℃ and energy density of 400 J/L, the maximum removal rates of benzene with different catalysts have the order of Au (93.8%)>Pt(81.1%)>Ag(81%)> non-catalyst (55%). 3) When using the same catalyst loadings and at the same reaction temperature, the benzene removal rates will increase with the increase in the energy density. 4) When using the same catalyst loadings and certain energy density, benzene removal rates will increase with the increase in reaction temperature. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

In this paper, the heavily contaminated silicone rubber surfaces were treated by using plasma jet in He generated at atmospheric pressure air, and the length of plasma jet, gas temperature, and optical emission spectrum were characterized. Effects of the processing time and discharge power on the hydrophobicity improvement were studied and the hydrophobicity transfer process was investigated. Results show that the jet can reach the maximum length of 46 mm, the gas temperature is in the range of 297~345 K, and the discharge produces a lot of active particles in excited state such as He, OH and N2+. After plasma jet treatment, the surface hydrophobicity can increase remarkably, and the static contact angle can reach saturation in 30 seconds. Increasing the discharge power can significantly accelerate the migration process. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

KELM was used to predict the TOT prediction error of typical Susa thermal circuit model, thent he prediction value was used to correct the TOT prediction result. To improve the prediction accuracy, the gravitational search algorithm(GS) was used to optimize the punishment coefficient and kernel parameter of KELM. The case study shows that the prediction results of the model proposed in this paper are in accordance with the measured results and are superior to results of semi-physical model without error correction- Susa thermal circuit model, and are also superior to results of model directly based on nonlinear fitting and regression method-KELM optimized by GS. The training time of KELM optimized by GS is substantially less than support vector machine optimized by GS and Elman neural network, and the prediction accuracy is slightly superior. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

895.html,Analysis of Insulation Methods to Reduce Influences of DC Grounding Electrode on Pipeline,"When a DC power transmission system is operated under monopolar ground circuit mode, thousands of amps of current can be injected into the ground from the DC grounding electrode, which will form a wide range of potential gradient in the ground, leading to a high potential on the buried metal pipe, and seriously affects the safe operation of oil and gas pipelines in the vicinity. We established an equivalent circuit model for the coating and insulation joints of the pipeline by the idea of numerical analysis of the grounding system. Through numerical simulation, the effectiveness and regularity of the two measures to reduce the influences of the DC ground current on the pipeline were studied, the optimized solutions to arrange the insulating joints were also studied. The research results show that, as the insulation resistance of the coating has already been very high, increasing the resistivity or thickness of the insulating coating to reduce ground current effect will have little effect. When there are damaged points on the pipeline, reinforced insulation coating will increase the current flowing through the damaged points, thus increasing the corrosion rate of the pipeline. Installing insulating joint on the pipeline can significantly reduce the influences of the ground current on the pipeline, which will greatly reduce the risk of pipeline coatings and cathodic protection equipment. The research results can provide a reference for reducing the influences of DC grounding electrode on pipeline. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

896.html,Pollution Flashover Characteristic of Composite Insulator with Non-uniform Hydrophobicity Distribution on Surfaces,"Considering the non-uniform distribution of hydrophobicity along composite insulator surface which may occur in field operation, we simulated seven typical distributions of hydrophobicity on composite insulator surfaces in lab. Then we expermentally investigated the simulated insulators with different hydrophobicity conditions using up-and-down method. Meanwhile, arc shape variations synchronized with voltage and current changing were recorded by a high speed camera. When the ratio of continuous hydrophobic area reaches 33%, the flashover voltage drops by more than 14.4% under the value of hydrophilic flashover voltage. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of bottom surface of insulator is the determinative factor to pollution flashover.Among the seven hydrophobicity conditions, each flashover voltage and discharge characteristic of insulator varies from each other distinctly. Results show that the wetting process reflected by leakage current variation can be classified as hydrophilic group and hydrophobic group, and the flashover can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous flashover, which is the main reason of flashover sharply dropping. For composite insulator in operation, when the ratio of continuous hydrophobic area is lower than certain value, the influence of non-uniform hydrophobicitydistribution on pollution flashover voltage must be taken into consideration. Meanwhile, hydrophobicity of bottom surface should be focused on in operation, which is one of the most important parameters in evaluation of pollution flashover withstanding performance. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

897.html,Measurement Method for Antenna Efficiency Based on Time & Frequency Domain Measurement in Reverberation Chamber,"In order to test the antenna efficiency accurately, measurement method for antenna efficiency based on the time & frequency domain measurement in a reverberation chamber (RC) is improved in this paper. By using the vector network analyzer (VNA) with a time domain option, the time constant and insertion loss of a RC can be measured and calculated. When measuring the time constant of a RC, the bandpass impulse should be used to make sure that the measurement results can be compared with continuous wave (CW) results taken at a specific frequency. When doing the antenna impedance mismatch correction in frequency domain, the S11of transmitting antenna should be measured in a RC, and the S22of receiving antenna should be measured in free space. The antenna efficiency testing error caused by the nonzero pulse bandwidth is evaluated, which shows that 300 MHz pulse bandwidth will lead to an error of 0.11 dB. The simulation and measurement results show that when the testing frequency range is from 3 GHz to 8.5 GHz, the maximum difference between the testing and simulating results is 0.295 dB. It shows that antenna efficiency can be measured accurately with the method proposed in this paper. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

898.html,Measurement and Frequency Analysis of Short Current and Its Ground Wire Shunting at Artificial Grounding Fault on AC and DC Transmission Lines,"Grounding short-circuit fault is a common fault for AC and DC transmission lines. The shunting of the short-circuit current in the ground wires and the frequency components of the short-circuit current are very important for analyzing the influences of the short-circuit current on the pipelines and other facilities near the transmission lines. Consequently, on the basis of the first ±500 kV HVDC transmission project in Yunnan Province, we artificially and experimentally investigated the grounding short-circuit on AC and DC transmission lines. The shunting of the short-circuit current was measured in the substation outlet or the middle of the transmission line depending on the position and the type of the fault.Moreover, the features of the current shunting and frequency components of the fault current were analyzed. The main conclusions are drawn as follows: AC short-circuit current decays with oscillation, and the frequency components consisting of 50 Hz is dominant, being accompanied with DC component with frequencies higher than 50 Hz. DC short-circuit current is a simple waveform without oscillation, which increases initially and then decreases. The main frequency component is below 30 Hz, which is related to the DC system blocking time. The frequency components also include a small amount of 50 Hz, 160 Hz, 340 Hz, and 1 800 Hz. According to all the tests, no matter short-circuit current takes place in the substation outlet or the middle of the transmission line, more than 60% of the short-circuit current flows away from the ground wires, which is consistent with the simulation result. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

ISTKB,"The present study investigates polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from lignin and its derivatives by a previously reported lignin-degrading bacterial strain Pandoraea sp. ISTKB. PHA production was screened by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using a Nile red stain. PHA and biomass accumulation, while screening, was found to be maximum on 4-hydroxybenzoic acid followed by p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and kraft lignin after 96 h. Monomer composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and was followed by Fourier transform infrared and1H NMR analysis, indicating PHA to be a copolymer of P(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate). Genomic analysis of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB also complemented the results of GC-MS and NMR, and the relevant genes responsible for the synthesis of small chain length PHA were discovered in the genome. Process parameters were optimized by response surface methodology for enhanced production of PHA and biomass on 4-hydroxybenzoate. Optimization results showed 30 and 66% increase in the biomass and PHA production, respectively. The results obtained were promising and indicated that if lignin is depolymerized into low-molecular-weight intermediates, then it can easily be utilized and converted into value-added products like PHA by microbes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Kumar Madan; Singhal Anjali; Verma Praveen Kumar; Thakur Indu Shekhar,School of Environmental Sciences\Jawaharlal Nehru University\India; National Institute of Plant Genome Research\Aruna Asaf Ali Marg\India,-,-

We examine a communicative phenomenon resulting from these symptoms: non-prototypical direct speech for non-reports involving an actual utterance from previously produced discourse (e.g. quoting somebody’s words to refer to them, Pascual 2014). We video-recorded the naturalistic speech of five Brazilian children with autism, five typically developing children of the same mental age, and five of the same chronological age. They all used so-called fictive speech (Pascual 2014, Dornelas & Pascual 2016) for narration, expressing needs, and referring to individuals and events (e.g. saying Goal! for ‘playing soccer’). Such verbatim fictive speech originated in specific prior interactions or in socio-communicative or socio-cultural knowledge. We found considerable differences in the three groups in the frequency and degree of creativeness of fictive speech as opposed to it representing standard linguistic formulae or echoing previously produced speech word by word. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",Pascual Esther; Dornelas Aline; Oakley Todd,Dept. of Spanish Language & Culture\Dept. of Linguistics\China; Department of Linguistics\Faculty of Arts\Brazil; Department of Cognitive Science\Case Western Reserve University\United States,-,Autistic Spectrum Disorder; echolalia; fictive conversation; language development; metonymy; verbatim quotation

Few lowland anastomosing rivers remain in temperate zones, and the protection of these river-floodplain systems is an international conservation priority. However, the mechanisms that drive the creation and maintenance of multiple channels, i.e. anabranches, are not well understood, particularly for lowland rivers, making it challenging to identify effective management strategies. This study uses a novel multi-scale, process-based hydro-geomorphological approach to investigate the natural and anthropogenic controls on anastomosis in lowland river reaches. Using a wide range of data (hydrologic, cartographic, remote-sensing, historical), the study (i) quantifies changes in the planform of the River Narew, Poland over the last 100 years, (ii) documents changes in the natural and anthropogenic factors that could be driving the geomorphic change, and (iii) develops a conceptual model of the controls of anastomosis. The results show that 110 km of anabranches have been lost from the Narew National Park (6810 ha), a 42% reduction in total anabranch length since 1900. The rates of anabranch loss have increased as the number of pressures inhibiting anabranch creation and maintenance has multiplied. The cessation of localized water level and channel management (fishing dams, water mills and timber rafting), the loss of traditional floodplain activities (seasonal mowing) and infrastructure construction (embanked roads and an upstream dam) are contributing to low water levels and flows, the deposition of sediment at anabranch inlets, the encroachment of common reed (Phragmites australis), and the eventual loss of anabranches. By identifying the processes driving the loss of anabranches, this study provides transferable insights into the controls of anastomosis in lowland rivers and the management solutions needed to preserve the unique anastomosing river pattern and diverse wet grasslands that are central to the conservation value of lowland floodplains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Marcinkowski Paweł; Grabowski Robert C.; Okruszko Tomasz,Department of Water Engineering\Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering\Poland; School of Water\Energy\United Kingdom,-,Anabranching; Floodplains; Fluvial geomorphology; Hydromorphology; Multithread river

Moreover, we calculated the effects of the gas mixture equivalence ratio on the combustion efficiency, flow field characteristics, distribution of wall pressure and combustion products,and total pressure loss by adjusting the fuel injection pressure to reach a certain equivalence ratio value. The results show that increasing the gas mixture equivalence ratio will reduce the combustion efficiency; The region between cavity front wall and plasma jet is the most fierce combustion reaction with the highest temperature, the heat release region of combustion reaction increases and cavity temperature decreases as the gas mixture equivalence ratio rises from 0.138 to 0.311, however,the heat release region of combustion reaction decreases and the combustion reaction occurs in downstream cavity when the gas mixture equivalence ratio is 0.485 and 0.624. The rising point of combustor top wall pressure moves towards upstream and the value of pressure increases as the gas mixture equivalence ratio increases; The total pressure loss in the combustor is mainly caused by the oblique shock wave by fuel jet, airstream, and heat release of combustion. Increasing the gas mixture equivalence ratio will enhance the total pressure loss caused by the oblique shock, but the total pressure loss in the combustor is mainly caused by the heat release of combustion. The more fierce combustion reaction is, the bigger the total pressure loss will be. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Moreover, we discussed the requirements for arresters in residual voltage, charge rate, the withstand capacity of power frequency overvoltage, and energy absorption capacity. After using LRA with 1.4 times of rated voltage, the operating overvoltage level can be reduced to 1.3~1.4 times of per-unit value when using LRA with 1.3 times of rated voltage, the value can be 1.2~1.3. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

On the basis of the introduction of key components and the structure of hybrid reactive compensation, we analyzed the characteristics of circuit breaker by simulation when the out-of-phase fault occurs in the UHV transmission lines with hybrid reactive compensation. With regard to the worst condition of the out-of-phase fault, the variation rules of the out-of-phase fault current and transient recovery voltage of circuit breakers were obtained. Using an equivalent lumped parameter circuit, the computational formula of the out-of-phase fault current and transient recovery voltage rising rate were deduced and computed. The relationship between the out-of-phase fault current and hybrid reactive compensation was presented, and out-of-step fault current would increase nonlinearly with the increase of compensation degree of series compensation. Based on the above method, the variation rules of the out-of-phase fault current and transient recovery voltage in UHV transmission line were studied in the presence and absence of hybrid reactive compensation. The results show that the peak value of transient recovery voltage and its rising rate increases exponentially with the increase of the compensation degree of series compensation in the hybrid reactive compensation. However, the change of the controllable high compensation degree has little effect on the peak value and the rise rate of the transient recovery voltage. In view of the out-of-phase fault interruption characteristics, the research results provide an analysis foundation and theoretical basis for parameter optimization of the hybrid reactive compensation and arrangement selection of circuit breaker in UHV transmission line. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

As the weak position in the seismic performance of the transformer, the seismic capacity of UHV bushing directly affects the seismic fortification level of UHV substation. In this study, one 1 100 kV UHV bushing was tested by shaking table. The dynamic characteristics and seismic response such as strain and acceleration of the key parts of the UHV bushing were obtained by the input of white noise wave and standard time history wave. The test results show that the maximum stress of porcelain pieces of the bushing is lower than the failure strength, but the flange of the bushing is damaged, which means the device does not meet the seismic design requirements of 3 m/s2. The test results indicate that the metal flange part is the weak part of the bushing.

The algorithm uses the PD signal amplitude mutation and the propagation characteristics in cable to identify the PD matching pair, locates the multiple PD sources based on the identify results, and corrects the location results through the DBSCAN clustering method to realize the accurate location of multiple PD sources. The simulation results show that the multi-source PD location algorithm can effectively identify the PD matching pair and accurately estimate the numbers and location of PD sources in different SNR conditions.

We used the collision ionization theory to illustrate the mechanism of the temperature influence on the insulation performance of SF6/N2gas mixture. Moreover, we verified the experimental results of the insulation performance of SF6/N2gas mixture by theoretical analysis, which was one of SF6alternative choices, under high pressure and low temperature at −35℃, −18℃ and 0℃. The sphere-plate and rod-plate aluminum electrodes were applied to create the uniform and non-uniform electric field. The polarity effect of breakdown voltage of SF6/N2and pure SF6as well as the electric field coefficient can be obtained. It is found that the electric field sensitivity factor of SF6/N2at 0.7 MPa with 20% SF6is lower than that of SF6at 0.4 MPa under a positive impulse voltage. However, the electric field sensitivity factor of SF6/N2or SF6is similar under a negative voltage. Meanwhile, it is found that the p-T characteristics of real gases deviate from ideal gases, which becomes greater as the temperature lowers. The compressibility factor of SF6/N2gas mixture with pressure of 0.7 MPa and SF6mole ratio of 20% is obtained through the test. The compressibility factor increases linearly with the decrease of temperature from 0℃ to −35℃. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Repulsion mechanism and its basic principle are introduced in this paper, and different structures of repulsion mechanism as well as their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Combined research on numerical analysis and analytical analysis of driving characteristics, the research achievements are concluded and analyzed. It is pointed out that regularity exploring can only give an empirical optimization rule, and it is difficult to accurately describe the optimal design scheme. The analytical analysis should be the focus of the current research. Finally, it is concluded that future research on repulsion mechanism should focus on improving the energy conversion efficiency and the proper buffer. The holding technology, the impact stress analysis and the structure design approach of the drive system, and application in long-gap drive should be adopted. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

907.html,Numerical Simulation of Steady Plasma Actuation on Improving Film Cooling Efficiency,"To explore the mechanism of plasma aerodynamic actuation on improving the cooling efficiency of flat plate film, by a large eddy simulation, we investigated the effects of the position and number of plasma actuator on the film cooling performance, and adopted the phenomenological plasma model to represent the plasma-induced body force generated by actuator on the fluid. Results show that as the distance between the plasma actuator and the cooling hole exit decreases, the downward momentum effect of plasma on the cooling jet grows larger, and the jet trajectory stays closer to the wall. When the plasma actuator is installed at x/d=0, the maximum jet exit streamwise and vertical velocities will increase by 10% and 3%, respectively, but the vertical velocity near the leading edge decreases by 2%, then the mixing process of between the jet and the crossflow at the upwind side of the jet is suppressed, and the kidney shaped vortex loses its strength, thus the centerline film cooling efficiency will increase by 40%. Moreover, due to the downward momentum and momentum injection effects of the second plasma actuator, the cooling jet stays closer to the wall and stretches farther downstream with two plasma actuators, and the hairpin vortex breaks into smaller near-wall streaks, so the centerline and lateral-averaged film cooling efficiency will increase by 17% and 40%, respectively, compared with the single-plasma actuator case. In addition, under the same actuation strength, optimization arrangement of actuator number can promote the performances of plasma actuation in improving film cooling efficiency. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Meanwhile, we obtained the flashover characteristics curves of power frequency voltage, 1 000 μs long wave-front switching impulse voltage, and lightning impulse of UHV AC double-circuit tower. Results show that the 50% flashover voltage gradient of bottom phase air-gaps is higher than that of middle phase. The 50% flashover voltage gradient of 1 000 μs wave-front switching impulse of bottom phase air-gaps is 4.6% higher than that of the middle phase. Based on the test results and the characteristics of operating voltage and over-voltage of UHV AC power transmission system, the UHV AC double-circuit tower inverse V-type insulator air-gaps configuration is proposed. The air-gaps configuration of power frequency voltage and switching overvoltage are 2.9 m and 6.5 m, and the lightning protection air-gaps are 6.7 m and 7.2 m in mountains and plains, respectively. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Consequently, we established an anode thermal model considering the Joule heating, thermal conduction, and radiation. Then we used the heat flux density(HFD) on the anode surface calculated by a previous numerical simulation of vacuum arc as a boundary condition, and adopted the sensible heat capacity method to analyze the latent heat. Moreover, we studied the anode heating process and post-arc cooling process during the current interruption of VCB, and analyzed the evolution of anode temperature, molten region size, vapor pressure, and vapor flux density. The investigation shown that:1) the maximum temperature of anode has about 2~3 ms time delay compared with peak current. 2) With the typical arcing parameters, the maximum anode temperature and molten region appear at 8 ms. The anode temperature decreases rapidly after the occurrence of arc. The molten region disappears after 12 ms. 3) With the increase of the peak arc current, the temperature at anode center rises and the existing time of molten region extends. Because the vapor pressure and vapor flux density on anode surface are high after the occurrence of arc, the recovery of dielectric strength will be influenced. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The driving forces for the development of sludge bulking, however, have not been well understood because of the extremely low growth rate of M. parvicella. In this study, batch experiments were performed using bulking sludge (sludge volume index (SVI), around 185 mL g− 1) from a full-scale WWTP as the seed sludge to investigate the influences of carbon source, anaerobic/aerobic alternation condition and temperature on the growth of M. parvicella. The qPCR results showed that the use of oleic acid as carbon source, anaerobic/aerobic alternation treatment and low temperature (13 °C) were favorable conditions for maintaining the dominance of M. parvicella in the tested activated sludge. Under these conditions, the SVI values remained at comparatively high values of 170.5 mL g− 1, 162.5 mL g− 1and 129.5 mL g− 1after operation for approximately two months, and the relative abundances of M. parvicella were 36.7%, 9.74% and 34.07%, respectively, in comparison with the initial values of 33.04%, 29.29% and 54.66%. However, the relative abundances of M. parvicella decreased to 0.86–4.44%, 0.7% and 4.94%, respectively, under the conditions of other carbon sources, aerobic-only treatment and a temperature of 20 °C. The FISH analysis gave a similar result. This study was performed with mixed sludge under controlled operating conditions, which provided a valuable information for the pure culture of M. parvicella and further investigations on its physiology and metabolism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fan Niansi; Qi Rong; Rossetti Simona; Tandoi Valter; Gao Yingxin; Yang Min,State Key Laboratory of Environmental Aquatic Chemistry\Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences\China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences\Beijing\China; CNR\Water Research Institute\Italy,-,Anaerobic/aerobic alternation condition; Bulking sludge; Carbon source; Microthrix parvicella; Temperature
910.html,Effects of Different Nano Fillers on Electrical Properties of Polyimide Films Under Impulse Voltage,"In order to study the influences of different nano fillers on the electrical properties of PI film, pure PI film, we prepared a 10% PI/SiO2film and 10% PI/Al2O3film by an in-situ polymerization method. Meanwhile, we tested the conductivity, dielectric spectrum, partial discharge (PD), and corona-resistant property, and determined the microstructure after breakdown by SEM. The results show that the conductivity of PI/SiO2film is greater than that of PI/Al2O3film, and the surface conductivity of PI/SiO2film is 5 times bigger than that of PI/Al2O3film. The dielectric constant decreases in the sequence of PI/Al2O3film, PI/SiO2film, and PI film. The dielectric loss (tanδ) of PI/SiO2film and PI film first decrease and then increase with the increase of frequency. The tanδ of PI/Al2O3film is the highest after 6 KHz. The tanδ-f curve of PI/Al2O3film turns out a peak at 200Hz caused by relaxation of space charge. The partial discharge inception voltage and corona resistance time decrease in the sequence of PI/SiO2film, PI/Al2O3film, and PI film, but the change tendency of average amplitude of PD is on the contrary. There are some micro holes and gaps on the surfaces of the three films. The results indicate that the interface volume fraction and nanoparticles polarity are the main reasons for differences between the electrical properties of PI/SiO2film and PI/Al2O3film. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The simulation model of pulse power supply and simple railgun is established. In the simulation, the rail current is reduced to zero before the armature out of the muzzle and the energy is recovered. In addition, the influences of the parameter of capacitance and the termination of the discharge time on the system performance are analyzed. The results of simulation and experiment show that four kinds of operating modes, including charging, discharging, termination of discharging, and energy recovery, can be realized through the topology. In the experiment, the current pulses with amplitude within 166 A are achieved when the charge current value is 16.48 A. Through the termination of discharging and energy recovery process, the final feedback current reaches 11.2 A, and the system energy loss is reduced by 45.78%. The design of capacitor parameters should be considered in the voltage stress and the requirements for pulse current waveforms. The termination of the discharge time should be as late as possible under consideration of delay. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

912.html,Numerical Calculation of Bundle Conductor Surface Electric Field on Transmission Tower Based on Boundary Element Method,"In order to accurately calculate the electromagnetic environment near transmission lines and provide a reference for optimizing the tower and the line, we numerically analyze the electric field on the surface of the bundle conductor near the transmission tower. According to the characteristics of the tower, assuming that tower model consists of a series of cylindrical conductors, a cylindrical conductor is set as a line element, and the bundle conductor surface is set as a plane element. The tower and wire system, as a whole, are calculated with the line-plane mixed boundary element method. According to the characteristics of the conductor surface subdivision unit, improvement measures are proposed on the Gauss integral method.Namely, increasing Gauss points on the long direction of the split unit to reduce the computational memory and improve efficiency, meanwhile, considering the effects of transmission lines on both sides of the calculation model and the earth mirror. The calculation results show that the line-plane boundary element method can calculate bundle conductor surface electric field distribution near the tower more accurately and effectively; Bundle conductor surface electric field near the tower will be significantly increased, and as it is more and more away from the tower, the tower impact decreases rapidly, and the influence of the towers in the middle phase conductor is relatively large. Under normal circumstances, when the aspect ratio is less than 16 times, the Gauss quadrature value of the calculation result is rather accurate. After Gaussian integral is improved, when the aspect ratio of split unit is 64 times, the value of the result is still relatively accurate. So, the accuracy and efficiency are significantly improved; When the distance between the semi-infinite wire and computing point is relatively close, the impact on the calculation result is relatively remarkable.When the distance is relatively far, the impact is relatively small. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Due to the influence of factors such as attenuation, reflection, and winding resonance of the lightning impulse voltage of the transformer, the intrusion waveform has the oscillation attenuation and bipolarity. The waveform differs greatly from the standard lightning waveform specified by IEC. In this paper, based on the actual recorded invading lightning impulses in a substation, damped alternating oscillation voltage was applied to the column-to-column insulation model. The characteristics of relationship between the amplitude of applied voltage and the accumulative number of times (U-N characteristics) under damped alternating oscillation voltages were determined. To study the accumulative damage effect, the surface morphology was observed, and the electric parameters, such as relative dielectric constant, were measured before/after the accumulative tests. As a result, the experimental results showed an evident accumulative effect of oil-impregnated paper insulation under multiple damped alternating oscillation voltages. Ivory colloidal attachments can be found on the samples within the electrode covering area and the surface roughness of samples increases. Also, both the relative dielectric constant and the dielectric loss factor obviously increase with the increasing of accumulation times. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

914.html,Correlations Between Carrier Lifetime and Reverse Recovery Characteristics of High Power Thyristors,"The reverse recovery characteristics of high power thyristors is important to improve the voltage distribution and reduce the commutation failure of HVDC thyristor valve. Consequently, we studied the reverse recovery characteristics of high power thyristors in two aspects, nanmely, external operating conditions and internal device parameters. Moreover, we experimentally studied the effect of power frequency current on reverse recovery characteristics of high power thyristors by, combining terminal characteristics with internal physical process, and established the relationship of carrier lifetime and reverse recovery time. Thereafter, the influence of reverse recovery characteristics on thyristor valve was analyzed. The results show that the high-level injection lifetime is approximately equal to the reverse recovery storage time with a sine wave; the dominant factor affecting reverse recovery characteristics is lifetime; to meet the demands of voltage and current of high power thyristors, thyristor valve should take thyristors series with the same or similar lifetime. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

How to analyze the voltage stability of converter buses of 500 kV layer and 1 000 kV layer near landing points is urgent and needs to be studied further. Consequently, we analyze firstly the power output characteristic of inverters of different layers according to a mathematical model of the new connection mode, and derive a numerical calculation method of comprehensive voltage stability factor by using the reduced order Jacobian matrix to evaluate voltage stability of converter buses. It is shown that being granter than and closer to zero of the factor indicates the better stability of converter buses. Furthermore,the voltage stability of converter buses under various DC control modes is studied by using the factor, and the sort of voltage stability is obtained. It can be seen from the sort that when the rectifier with constant current control or constant power control and the high- and low- end inverters of inverter station are adopted,,the constant voltage control has the best voltage stability as the factor is 0.341 0; when the rectifier with constant power control and the high- and low- end inverters of inverter station are adopted,the constant extinction angle control has the worst as the factor is 0.672 8. The effect of the transmission power on voltage stability is also investigated. The conclusion are that change of control mode form constant power to constant current for rectifier and change of control mode from constant extinction angle to constant voltage for the two inverters of inverter station can both improve voltage stability of converter buses near landing points, and relatively low transmission level of DC power are benefit to the voltage stability. Finally, simulation based on Ximeng-Taizhou UHVDC project shows the analytical method of this paper is reasonable and effective. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

It is mainly composed of a high-voltage power supply, a fast Marx generator and a trigger pulse generator. The high-voltage power supply is powered by low power electrical source, such as 30 V batteries. It is integrated with a super capacitors group for fast repetitive output with big power and high voltage (100 kV). There are polypropylene film capacitors with plastic shell, miniaturized gas switches, isolated inductors between capacitors and SF6gas insulation in the 8-stage fast Marx generator which possesses the maximal output voltage of 800 kV and storage energy of 1.6 kJ. A 5-stages Marx generator structure is utilized in trigger pulse generator with the maximal output voltage of 50 kV and pulse duration of about 500 ns. Both of the high-voltage power supply and trigger pulse generator make use of coagulated silicon colloid as in-house insulating medium. Therefore, they can have compact structures. The whole integrated pulsed power system has a volume of 0.9 m×0.45 m×0.45 m. In experiments, successive 5 pulses were gained on CuSO4liquid resistor load with repetitive rate of 10 Hz, peak voltage of more than 400 kV, peak current of more than 21 kA, and pulse duration of about 150 ns.

Consequently, we developed and designed the triggering vacuum gap (TVG) applied in the voltage grade under 35 kV. The characteristics of vacuum arc generated by TVG conduction were analyzed, including the working voltage, triggering delay, and current capability. The structure of multi-rods electrode was selected for TVG. The triggering electrode of TVG was designed, and the triggering modes and circuits were determined. TVG was bipolarly triggered and controlled to ensure its reliable triggering under AC voltage. Moreover, the electromagnetic forces of arcs generated by TVG conduction were calculated. And the arc movement was tested and observed, then the main electrodes of TVG were optimized. Based on the achievements from the key technology of TVG, the prototypes of 12 kV and 40.5 kV TVG were developed. The technical parameters were provided for products. The triggering performance, current, and insulation recovery ability of prototypes were experimentally investigated. The triggering voltage of 12 kV prototype is 0.5 kV, and that of 40.5 kV prototype is 5 kV. The triggering delay of two prototypes is less than 200 µs.

During transport and operation, winding deformation may occur due to unexpected collision or the strong electromotive force of the system short-circuit fault. Therefore, live detection is very important for safe and reliable operation of transformer winding. We designed a three-dimensional imaging detection device for transformer winding deformation based on ultrasonic technology. Firstly, in order to solve the problem of the placement of ultrasonic transmitting and receiving probe, an ultrasonic probe placement algorithm was proposed. By studying the placement method of ultrasonic probe in three different situations, the receiving effect of ultrasonic signal was improved.

In response, the State of Louisiana has proposed a $50 billion, 50-year restoration program. A central piece of this program is the reintroduction of Mississippi River water into the deltaic plain using managed diversions that mimic natural flood pulses. These diversions would transport critically needed sediment, but also deliver large nutrient loads. Coastal eutrophication is therefore a concern, particularly blooms of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. The Bonnet Carré Spillway (BCS) is an existing large flood diversion that protects New Orleans and provides an opportunity to investigate diversion nutrient transport. Here, we quantify sediment phosphorus (P) deposited by the BCS for the first time, and use a sequential P fractionation scheme to evaluate the likelihood of future sediment P release to the water column of the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary. In 2011, we collected sediment cores in the estuary for determination of P fractions before and after the discharge of 21.9 km3of river water through the BCS in just under 6 weeks. We observed the greatest net increases in sediment total P, inorganic P forms, and more labile organic P in the region near the inflow. We estimate that the diversion deposited ≥ 5000 metric tons of P in the sediments of the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary. The sum of readily available inorganic P, Fe/Al-bound inorganic P, and more labile organic P equaled approximately 20–30% of post-diversion sediment total P. These fractions are more likely to be released to the water column than the other sediment P forms we quantified. Diversion designs that encourage sedimentation in coastal marshes versus open bays can likely reduce the chances that deposited particulate P creates eutrophication risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Roy Eric D.; Nguyen Nhan T.; White John R.,Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources\University of Vermont\United States; Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences\College of the Coast and Environment\United States,-,Coastal restoration; Estuary; Eutrophication; Internal phosphorus loading; Phosphorus fractionation; River diversions

Consequently, adopting several common kinds of nitrates, such as KNO3, NH4NO3, NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2, and Mg(NO3)2as the soluble pollutants, we experimentally studied the AC flashover on anti-pollution porcelain insulator XP4−160. During the tests, a digging method was applied, and the up-and-down method was used, after which the NC flashover voltage gradients of insulator under different pollutants and equivalent salt deposit densities ρESDDvalues were obtained. Then based on the test results and combined with the physical and chemical characteristics, the effects of nitrates on insulator flashover performance were analyzed. The research results indicate that when the current method is used to calculate nitrates flashover voltage gradient of polluted insulators, the relative error will reach 24%; the flashover voltage gradient of insulators under nitrates are higher than that under NaCl; KNO3corresponds to lower flashover voltage gradient while Ca(NO3)2corresponds to higher; the pollution characteristic b under nitrates is within 0.18~0.25; the relationships between ELand ρESDDof the insulators can be expressed by 25.6 ρESDD-0.21.

Energy and repetition frequency are key factors for shock wave practical application. We proposed a method of using electrical wire explosion igniting energetic materials (EMs), which could increase shock wave energy and enhanced its damage effect under a proper working frequency,and analyzed the discharge property of electrical wire coated with energetic material. By analyzing the discharge waveforms and the shock wave waveforms, we studied the influences of wire diameters on ignition performances under different charging voltages. Results show that these EMs wrapped around the Cu-wire will absorb the shock wave energy to some extent, which will decrease shock wave peak pressure, while increase the impulse, and generally enhance the shock wave damaging ability. When the stored energy is low, an optimal wire dimension exists to ignite EM most effectively; when the stored energy is high, ignition performance is not sensitive to the wire parameters. Electrical explosion ignition may be a heat-radiation-shock combined process, and the three effects happen synchronously, so it is hard to distinguish their separate contributions. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The existing air gapped and non-air gapped arresters have their disadvantages, which are hard for installation and maintenance. We put forward a kind of arrester with feed-through structure containing annulus zinc oxide resistors, which is in series with insulator and grading rings to form a kind of 500 kV anti-lightning and anti-icing composite insulator.

However, there is few analyses for spectrum and the impact of the screen mesh size and atmospheric relative humidity are found in literatures. Consequently, for the purpose of exhaust gas treatment, we studied the effects of the screen mesh size and the relative humidity on discharge characteristics of gas-liquid two-phase DBD, and compared the different effects of the driving voltage frequency on gas-liquid two-phase and traditional plate-plate DBD.

On the basis of summarizing the status of technical research on power transmission in desert areas, we put forward the key prospect of power grid that should be resolved urgently. Firstly, the research progress in external insulation is reviewed to find the focus of power delivery in desert areas, and it is found that the important influential factors on the external insulation are high wind and heavy pollution. Secondly, the comment of research status is highlighted on the damages of sandstorm on transmission and transformation equipment. It is proposed that the laboratory of desert environment simulation should be established to research the wind-induced vibration of power equipment, and a synthetic effect of wind and sand dust should be considered. Finally, technological development is summarized on sand storms monitoring, and the suggestion is presented that applications of remote sensing, radar monitoring, and optical fiber technology should be reinforced in the power monitoring and warning mechanism for sand storm and emergency defense system for power grid in desert areas. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Wet process is affected by the atmospheric environment and the hygroscopicity together. We analyzed the moisture absorption of soluble and non-soluble substances, and chosed aluminium phosphate as a strong hygroscopicity material. The discharge test of pollution insulation was performed in constant humidity condition. Some leakage current characteristics were investigated to analyze the influences of non-soluble substance hygroscopicity, such as current waveform, fundamental current amplitude, 3rd harmonic current amplitude, and phase. Test results show that insulator leakage current is affected by insoluble substance hygroscopicity, and the influential extent depends on atmospheric humidity and the mount of strong hygroscopicity material. As the amount of aluminium phosphate exceeds 20%, the leakage current amplitude of aluminium phosphate is much larger than that of normal sample at the relative humidity of 70%. The phase between fundamental current and voltage is sensitive to the hygroscopicity of pollution layer.Hygroscopicity is the natural quality of pollution layer, which cannot be covered in the investigation of atmospheric humidity and pollution severity. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

93.html,Settling fluxes and sediment accumulation rates by the combined use of sediment traps and sediment cores in Tema Harbour (Ghana),"Settling fluxes and sediment accumulation rates in coastal Tema Harbour (Ghana) were investigated by the combined analyses of results in sediment traps and sediment cores. Sediment traps were deployed at 5 stations within the Tema Harbour at two sampling depths and were retrieved every two weeks till the end of 12 weeks to estimate the Settling Fluxes (SFs). Four sediment cores from the harbour were analysed for their radioactivity (7Be,234Th,210Pb,212Pb,226Ra,40K and137Cs) profiles to quantify Sediment Accumulation Rates (SARs). The sediment cores exhibited variable bulk density profiles, indicating highly dynamic and non-steady sedimentation conditions.7Be-derived gross-estimates of very recent SARs using the constant flux-constant sedimentation (CF-CS) model were in the range of 2.5–9.0 g·cm− 2·y− 1. These values were much lower than the estimated average SFs (15.2–53.8 g·cm− 2·y− 1), indicating sediment resuspension plays an important role. On a decadal time scale, conventional210Pb sediment dating models did not allow any estimation of SARs in the Tema Harbour. Thus, the210Pb-based TERESA model was applied to depict a reliable scenario for sedimentation with time-averaged SARs in the range of 1.4–3.0 g·cm− 2·y− 1and fluxes of matter contributed by the marine inflow and local sources. Sediment accretion rates of 1.7–3 cm·y− 1were also inferred, which may pose a moderate problem of sustainability for the Tema Harbour. This study reveals how the geochemical behaviour of different radionuclides with Gamma spectrometry in the marine environment can be used to obtain reliable information on the complex dynamics of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), even in a very disturbed and anthropic environment as a coastal harbour area where (1) conventional210Pb-based dating methods fail and (2) the use of sediment traps and234Th and7Be profiles in sediment cores show serious constraints. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Botwe Benjamin O.; Abril José M.; Schirone Antonio; Barsanti Mattia; Delbono Ivana; Delfanti Roberta; Nyarko Elvis; Lens Piet N.L.,IHE-DELFT Institute for Water Education\PO Box 3015\Netherlands; Departamento de Física Aplicada I\ETSIA Universidad de Sevilla\Spain; ENEA\Marine Environment Research Centre\Italy; University of Ghana\Department of Marine and Fisheries Sciences\Ghana,-,210Pb; 7Be; Sediment accumulation rate; Settling flux; Tema Harbour; TERESA model

From the relation between inductance and magnetic energy, we derived the expression of L′ for rail-type EML under 2-D transient conditions. To analyze the diffusion behaviors of electromagnetic field in the rail, we built the magnetic field diffusion equation, which was combined with the finite element software Ansoft-Maxwell, and simulated the magnetic field and current density distribution. The results show that the value of L′,under transient conditions, ranges from Kerrisk's high frequency L′ to Grover's low frequency L′, when the current diffuses from the rail surface to the state when the current is uniform throughout the rail cross section. The total current decreases or electrical conductivity changes, the diffusion behaviors of electromagnetic field will change, so does the transient L′ curve. We believe that the transient L′ curve is closely related to the diffusion behaviors of electromagnetic field, which is affected by the eddy current. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Using the FEM software ANSYS, we built the equivalent models of different converter valve units for electric field calculation. Considering the interaction of equipment on electric field distribution in one valve hall, we established 3 whole models of valve halls as the calculation region using different types of converter valve unit, respectively.The potential and electric field distribution of the 6 sets of valve units in each valve hall was calculated under normal operating conditions. And the electric field distribution characteristics of the shielding apparatus on 3 different typical types of valve units were analyzed and compared. The calculation results show that the maximum values of surface electric field strength of shielding apparatus on 3 typical valve unit type are 1 599 V/mm, 1 007 V/mm, 1 515 V/mm, respectively, lower than 2 000 V/mm, the electric-field criteria for design.

933.html,New Method to Describe Contamination Degree of Insulators by Effective Equivalent Salt Deposit Density,"The effective equivalent salt deposit density (EESDD) can represent the contaminated degree of power transmission and transformation equipment and can make up for the defect that the equivalent salt deposit density(ESDD) method has little correlation with the pollution flashover voltage. We introduced new measurement equipment of EESDD and studied the influences of the probe size, water consumption, and salt composition on the measurement of the EESDD through a series of artificial contamination tests. A probe with the size of 5.13 mm and 1.00 mm and water consumption of 0.02 mL/cm2was chosen. Then, the concrete method of EESDD was presented. At last, the method of EESDD was applied in the actual operation of power transmission and transformation equipment to compare the ESDD and EESDD of the surface of the insulators in different areas. Moreover, the regional characteristics of contamination were discussed to provide a basis for the further promotion of the EESDD. A conclusion can be drawn that EESDD is a good characterization of the parameters of the contamination degree and a quite good supplement for ESDD. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

934.html,Nonlinear Active Disturbance Rejection Control of Static Var Generator with Cascaded Unit Considering Time-delay Factor,"In order to meet the urgent requirements of dynamics and anti-interference performance of cascaded unit static var generator (SVG), a new kind of high order active disturbance rejection controlling algorithm was designed and applied to cascaded unit static var generator. Meanwhile, a time optimal controlling (ADRC) functional synthesizer was designed and used as nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF) controlling method. The results show that the proposed control algorithm uses the nonlinear fastest-speed control synthesis function as the control algorithm of tracking difference (TD) and NLSEF, which has solved the problem of high frequency oscillation and filter difference of tandem SVG reactive current. The results of MATLAB simulation and prototype experiments show that the transient process of SVG system which adapts the high-order active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithm proposed by this paper has been shorten by over 100 ms compared with proportional resonant control, and ADRC algorithm can avoid poor filtering and integral saturation during transition. On the basis of the simulation and experimental results, the faster dynamic response and stronger robustness can be obtained and verified with the designed ADRC algorithm. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

935.html,Air-cooled Thermal Circuit Model and FBG Temperature Measurement of Transformer Winding,"In order to discover the abnormal temperature rise during long-term operation of the oil immersed power transformer, the monitor and judgment of the winding temperature are needed. Through the analysis of transformer heat generation and conduction during the air cooling process, and combined with thermoelectricity analogy method, an air cooling thermal circuit model of transformer winding temperature was established, and the transformer winding temperature along with the transformer operation process was processed. In order to verify the analysis results, according to the transformer high voltage and electromagnetic field, the insulation and electric breakdown properties of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology was used to monitor the temperature of transformer winding. The results show that, in the absence of the transformer air cooling effect, the maximum deviation between model analysis results and the measured results is about 14.4℃; however, in the presence of the air cooling effect, the maximum deviation between the model calculation results and the measured data is 2℃. The air cooling model can realize the temperature analysis of the air-cooled natural oil circulation oil immersed power transformer winding, and the abnormal temperature rise of the transformer winding can be judged by combining the measured results. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

936.html,Waveform Analysis and Feature Extraction of Partial Discharge UHF Signals in Gas Insulated Switchgear,"Ultra high frequency (UHF) method gradually becomes an effective approach for partial discharge (PD) detection in gas insulated switchgear (GIS). The waveform of UHF signals can be acquired by digital detection instruments with a high sampling rate. By analyzing the waveform characteristics of UHF signals, the extracted features can be applied to separation of mixed signals originated from multiple PD sources. Consequently, we proposed a signal feature extraction algorithm based on waveform analysis technique. The envelope curves of UHF signals were obtained by using the Gaussian smoothing method, and some features such as rising time and falling time were extracted. The zero-cross rate was extracted to represent the oscillating characteristics of UHF signals. Moreover, the mathematical morphology gradient (MMG) of cumulative energy function was calculated to characterize its rise steepness. Thereafter, the extracted features were applied to separation of mixed UHF signals. Experiments on four typical defects, including protrusion, free-moving particle, floating electrode, and metal wire, on spacer were performed, and the classification performances of the extracted features were tested with the acquired signals. By clustering the extracted features with the fuzzy maximum likelihood algorithm, mixed UHF signals of two multi-defect models were successfully separated. The results suggest that the proposed method is effective for representing UHF signal characteristics. The extracted features can accurately classify UHF signals generated by different typical defects in GIS, and can effectively separate the PD signals of multiple defect sources. © 2017, High Voltage Engineering  Editorial Department of CEPRI.

Two series of azocarboxamides were synthesized as potential radioligands for dopamine D3 and the μ-opioid receptor, revealing compounds 3d and 3e with single-digit and sub-nanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and compound 4c with only micromolar affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, but enhanced selectivity for the μ-subtype in comparison to the lead compound AH-7921. A ""minimalist procedure"" without the use of a cryptand and base for the preparation of 4-[18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [18F]2a was established, together with the radiosynthesis of methyl-, methoxy-, and phenyl-substituted derivatives ([18F]2b-f). With the substituted [18F]fluorophenylazocarbylates in hand, two prototype azocarboxylates radioligands were synthesized by18F-fluoroarylation, namely the methoxy azocarboxamide [18F]3d as the D3 receptor radioligand and [18F]4a as a prototype structure of the μ-opioid receptor radioligand. By introducing the new series of [18F]fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters, the method of18F-fluoroarylation was significantly expanded, thereby demonstrating the versatility of18F-labeled phenylazocarboxylates for the design of potential radiotracers for positron emission tomography. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Nebel Natascha; Strauch Brigitte; Maschauer Simone; Lasch Roman; Rampp Hannelore; Fehler Stefanie K.; Bock Leonard R.; Hübner Harald; Gmeiner Peter; Heinrich Markus R.; Prante Olaf,Department of Nuclear Medicine\Molecular Imaging and Radiochemistry\Germany; Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy\Medicinal Chemistry\Germany,-,-

Finding the suitable bankruptcy prediction model is the task for economists and analysts from all over the world. forecasting model using. Despite a large number of various models, which have been created by using different methods with the aim to achieve the best results, it is still challenging to predict bankruptcy risk, as corporations have become more global and more complex. Purpose of the article: The aim of the presented study is to construct, via an empirical study of relevant literature and application of suitable chosen mathematical statistical methods, models for bankruptcy prediction of Slovak companies and provide the comparison of overall prediction ability of the two developed models. Methods: The research was conducted on the data set of Slovak corporations covering the period of the year 2015, and two mathematical statistical methods were applied. The methods are logit and probit, which are both symmetric binary choice models, also known as conditional probability models. On the other hand, these methods show some significant differences in process of model formation, as well as in achieved results. Findings & Value added: Given the fact that mostly discriminant analysis and logistic regression are used for the construction of bankruptcy prediction models, we have focused our attention on the development bankruptcy prediction model in the Slovak Republic via logistic regression and probit. The results of the study suggest that the model based on a logit functions slightly outperforms the classification accuracy of probit model. Differences were obtained also in the detection of the most significant predictors of bankruptcy prediction in these types of models constructed in Slovak companies. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

939.html,"Cultural, political and economic roots of the labor market institutional framework in the oecd and post-socialist countries","Research background:The literature indicates that labor market institutions are determined by cultural, political and economic factors, but does not give explicit conclusions which of these vast group of factors dominates. Purpose of the article: The goal of this study is to empirically assess whether cultural and political factors dominate over economic factors in shaping the labor market institutional framework in the OECD and post-socialist countries. Methods: This framework can be measured by a vast group of indicators. We use 10 such variables that describe the group of 47 post-socialist and OECD countries (that did not experience economic transition) in the years 2005–2009. These indicators allow to construct one Employment Efficiency Index which explains almost 47% of the employment rate heterogeneity in the years 2010–2015. In the second step, the Employment Efficiency Index is regressed on 7 uncorrelated and standardized components that describe the cultural, political and economic characteristics of the analyzed countries in the years 1995–2004 and the Chow test is conducted in order to determine whether they influence the Index with the same strength in post-socialist and non-transition OECD countries. Findings & Value added: The obtained results show that cultural and political factors have a stronger influence on labor market institutions. Moreover, the estimates reveal that the countries which experienced weak labor market performance in the period 1995–2004 did not make their institutional framework more pro-employment in the following years and, in consequence, also recorded low values of the employment rate in the period 2010–2015. Such result suggests that economic factors occurred to be on average an insufficient trigger for labor market reforms in the group of analyzed countries. Finally, the Chow test revealed that this conclusion is applicable to both post-socialist and non-transition OECD countries. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

Superparamagnetic manganese ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized following co-precipitation method and then SiO2shell was coated on the magnetic core with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) through a silanization reaction to prevent oxidation, agglomeration and, increase the density of OH groups on the surface of MnFe2O4. Subsequently, MnFe2O4@SiO2@PMIDA obtained as a result of the reaction between N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) and MnFe2O4@SiO2.

Pesticides have been found in bodies of water that are located near areas where pesticides are commonly used and easily spread to beaches, lakes, and rivers; affect the species living in those waterways; and harm humans who come into contact with or eat fish from such water. Reported herein is the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of four organochlorine pesticides in a variety of water sources across the state of Rhode Island using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection. This method relies on the ability of cyclodextrin to promote analyte-specific fluorescence modulation of a high quantum yield fluorophore when a pesticide is in close proximity, combined with subsequent array-based statistical analyses of the measurable changes in the emission signals. This system operates with high sensitivity (low micromolar detection limits), selectivity (100% differentiation between structurally similar analytes), and general applicability (for different water samples with varying salinity and pH as well as for different water temperatures). © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Discenza Dana J.; Lynch Julie; Miller Jasmine; Verderame Molly; Levine Mindy,Department of Chemistry\University of Rhode Island\United States,-,-
941.html,Structural transformation and economic development in the best performing sub-saharan african states,"Research background:Economic development in sub-Saharan Africa is of paramount importance, yet it escapes most of the attempts to understand it better in the economic discourse, and it remains a sensitive issue in politics, contradicting stakeholders at national and international levels. The region still lags behind others in terms of technological advancement and economic development. It has grown significantly in the precedent decade, but the extent of growth has not sufficiently translated to its development. Determining strategies for sub-Saharan Africa is a scientific challenge, which requires more attention. In the globalized, interconnected reality, solving problems of the South is in the best interest of the North. Purpose of the article: The aim of this research is to analyze structural changes as factors of economic development in the best performing sub-Saharan African countries on the grounds of new structural economics in order to provide policy implications. Methods: Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Gabon were selected as best performing economies in the region. Based on the literature review and the analysis of descriptive statistics, profiles of sample countries were set. This in turn allowed to determine the potential explanatory variables for OLS model of economic development. In the model, factors relating to labour productivity, technology and structural change were included. The data was sourced from WDI (World Development Indicators) database, Gretl software was used for computations. Findings & Value added: This paper contributes to the literature by attempting to explain structural changes in the process of economic development in the sub-Saharan region on the sample of best performing states. Results of the study revealed that there is no common way of economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. However, best performing states are characterized by relative advantage in human capital. Based on the results, policy implications were proposed with respect to technology promotion, natural resources management, and quality of institutions.

942.html,National intellectual capital influence on economic growth in the European Union countries,"Research background:Importance of intangible resources for country’s economic growth is widely recognized. However, empirical evidence of this influence is hard to show due to measurement limitations of intangible resources. Majority of empirical studies concentrates on the analysis of a specific type of intangible resource’s influence on economic growth. National intellectual capital concept provides background for an integrated assessment of the country's intangible resources. This new approach enables the estimation of intangible resources’ influence to economic growth in a more complex way. Purpose of the article: a) To examine various scientific approaches of the national intellectual capital and its impact on the economic growth; b) to offer a measurement model of the national intellectual capital influence on economic growth; c) to evaluate the specific European Union countries’ intellectual capital’s effect on their economic growth. Methods: Econometric analysis; refined factor value computation method using the stand-ardized regression coefficients; the SAW method; expert evaluation, cluster analysis; correlation and regression analyses. Findings & Value added: A review of the economic growth theories showed that structural components of intellectual capital (human capital, structural capital, social capital, relational capital) in economic growth theories are analyzed as key determinants of economic growth. Our proposed research methodology consists time lag between variables and this let us evaluate casual relation. Empirical analysis of 25 European Union countries’ intellectual capital’s effect on their economic growth rate revealed that national intellectual capital and the countries’ level of economic development have statistically significant impact on economic growth rate. The analysis of intellectual capital components’ influence on economic growth rate of 25 European Union countries showed that only human capital and the level of economic development have statistically significant influence. A more comprehensive human capital’s influence on economic growth analysis revealed that 63.1 percent of the long-term economic growth rate in 25 European Union countries can be explained by differences in their economic development level and differences in educational achievement factor values. Moreover, analysis of national intellectual capital effect on economic growth in separate clusters allowed to identify influence differences in each group of countries. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

It was found that the pH of the reaction solution was critical in determining the fluorescence of CuNCs. CuNCs with blue and yellow fluorescent emission were obtained under basic and acidic conditions, respectively. Although the detailed formation mechanisms of these CuNCs required further analysis, the synthetic route was promising for preparing different fluorescent metal NCs for applications. With good water solubility and excellent photostability, the yellow-emitting CuNCs could serve as a fluorescence probe for detection of Hg2+based on the aggregation-induced quenching mechanism. The fluorescence quenching efficiency had fantastic linearity to Hg2+concentrations in the range of 0.1−100 μM, with a limit of detection of 30 nM. Additionally, the yellow-emitting CuNCs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and were successfully applied to bioimaging of HeLa cells. © 2017 American Chemical Society",Feng Jie; Chen Yonglei; Han Yangxia; Liu Juanjuan; Ma Sudai; Zhang Huige; Chen Xingguo,State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry\Department of Chemistry\China; Key Laboratory of Nonferrous Metal Chemistry and Resources Utilization of Gansu Province\Lanzhou University\China,-,-

Metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs) have many advantages over others due to their easy functionalization, high surface area, and low cost. However, they typically need a high work temperature during sensing process. Here, p-type sensing layer is reported, consisting of pore-rich dumbbell-like Co3O4particles (DP-Co3O4) with intrinsic high catalytic activity. The gas sensor (GS) based DP-Co3O4catalyst exhibits ultrahigh NH3sensing activity along with excellent stability over other structure based NH3GSs in room temperature work environment. In addition, the unique structure of DP-Co3O4with pore-rich and high catalytic activity endows fast gas diffusion rate and high sensitivity at room temperature. Taken together, the findings in this work highlight the merit of integrating highly active materials in p-type materials, offering a framework to develop high-sensitivity room temperature sensing platforms.                          © 2017",Zhou Tingting; Zhang Tong; Zhang Rui; Lou Zheng; Deng Jianan; Wang Lili,State Key Laboratory on Integrated Optoelectronics\College of Electronic Science and Engineering\China; State Key Laboratory for Superlattices and Microstructures\Institute of Semiconductor\China,-,Chemical sensor; Co3O4; p-type semiconductor; Room temperature; Ultrahigh-sensitive
950.html,"Synthesis and Characterization of Thermoresponsive Hydrogels Based on N-Isopropylacrylamide Crosslinked with 4,4′-Dihydroxybiphenyl Diacrylate","A novel crosslinker [4,4′-dihydroxybiphenyl diacrylate (44BDA)] was developed, and a series of temperature-responsive hydrogels were synthesized through free radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) with 44BDA. The temperature-responsive behavior of the resulting gels was characterized by swelling studies, and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogels was characterized through differential scanning calorimetry. Increased content of 44BDA led to a decreased swelling ratio and shifted the LCST to lower temperatures. These novel hydrogels also displayed resiliency through multiple swelling-deswelling cycles, and their temperature responsiveness was reversible. The successful synthesis of NIPAAm-based hydrogels crosslinked with 44BDA has led to a new class of temperature-responsive hydrogel systems with a variety of potential applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Tang Shuo; Floy Martha; Bhandari Rohit; Sunkara Manjula; Morris Andrew J.; Dziubla Thomas D.; Hilt J.

951.html,The Abydos Dynasty: An osteoarchaeological examination of human remains from the SIP royal cemetery,"Human skeletal remains from several individuals found in association with recently discovered tombs in south Abydos compose an osteological sample from a dynasty that ruled in central Egypt c. 1650 BC during Egypt's Second Intermediate Period. As part of the 2014 -2015 season at south Abydos, an osteoarchaeological examination of the skeletal remains was conducted for the purposes of determining sex, age, stature, population affinity, and anomalous conditions. The osteological analysis identified muscle markings which shed light on the physical stresses experienced by these individuals. While the examination of the only pharaoh with an associated name, Woseribre-Senebkay (CS9), presents a fascinating ancient forensic case of violent death, his skeleton, and those of the other cemetery occupants, also bear markers of stress on bone which can be traced to certain repetitive physical activities. This paper discusses the results of this examination, which point to men who were physically active and whose bodies show evidence of injury and healing. We propose that the muscle stress markers on these bodies are consistent with equestrian activity. The bearing of this evidence on the introduction of the horse (Equus ferus caballus) to Egypt in the Second Intermediate Period is mentioned. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

952.html,Of Min and moon - cosmological concepts in the Temple of Athribis (Upper Egypt),"The Graeco-Roman temple of Athribis near Sohag which is dedicated to the lion goddess Repit and to the ithyphallic god Min or Min-Re has recently been re-excavated. Epigraphic evidence refers to a complex association between Min and the moon. The intrinsic ties between the god and the celestial body might be derived from the divine virility which was also attributed to the moon in its tauriform emanation. This aspect of sexuality and fertility is also epitomised by the moon's monthly waxing. The different lunar aspects of Min and the complex web of cosmological relationships between Min and Repit are described. As divine personifications of moon and sun, their connection was displayed in different facets and levels of connotation. Ritual inscriptions that describe exotic aromata from the land Punt convey another, indirect reference to lunar mythology. The indispensable ingredients of an unguent's recipe were monumentally depicted in the sanctuary. As lord of the eastern desert, Min was directly related to the trading routes that crossed his dominion on their route to Punt. Additionally, the descriptions of the exotic southern region implicitly broach the myth of the Distant Goddess personified as Repit, the right eye of the sun god. The unguent was mythically required to embalm Osiris, whose healing in turn can be associated with the composition of the moon's eye. Thus, at Athribis the interwoven dichotomy of solar and lunar worship can be traced in multiple mythological and ceremonial accounts. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

953.html,Names of eye parts in different text genres: A contribution to technical language in ancient Egypt,"In ancient Egypt the eye has a great metaphorical and symbolic value. Additionally, several eye parts are known from medical, magical and religious texts, which until now have not been subject to examination. So the focus of this paper will be on these eye parts and their lexicology, especially the different semantics, formation, and practical contexts. In particular, different texts have a specialized terminology concerning the parts of the eye, and these differences are based on the respective text's functions. This can argue for the existence of technical language in Egyptian language in general. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

954.html,The complete corpus of viticulture and winemaking scenes from the ancient Egyptian private tombs,"The 'Study of viticulture and oenology in the Egyptian tombs' research project (2011-2014) documents and studies the corpus of viticulture and winemaking scenes in the ancient Egyptian private tombs. This scientific project, directed by Dr Maria Rosa Guasch-Jané, was hosted by the Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Humanas of the Universidade Nova in Lisbon (Portugal), and funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) of the Portuguese Ministry of Education and Science. The project's main goal is to provide scholars with a complete, comprehensive, archaeological and bibliographical database for the scenes of viticulture and winemaking depicted in the ancient Egyptian private tombs. The research work focuses on the study of viticulture and winemaking scenes through archaeological evidence, based on the documented material that our project team has recorded from the Egyptological archives, and on the photography work carried out in the tombs in Egypt. This paper presents the final stage of the research and the two databases (bibliography and scene-detail), which will be accessible on the project's website, together with the project's highlights. A bibliographical, researchable database relevant to wine, viticulture and winemaking in ancient Egypt has been completed, with 200 entries, including articles, monographs, book chapters, academic theses, essays, abstracts, on-line articles and websites. Furthermore, a scene-detail database with 92 records of tombs dated from the Old Kingdom (4th Dynasty) until the Late Period (30th-31st Dynasty) has been developed. The project methodology included data collection analysis of the archives, compilation of documents and all the information associated with Egyptian tombs with scenes of viticulture and winemaking, i.e. location, tomb-owner names and titles, dating, etc. This comprehensive study of all scenes and associated texts, combined with a photographic survey in Egypt during 2013, has permitted us to record and analyze all the scenes, including some unpublished ones. This photographic survey of the graves containing images related to viticulture and winemaking was also undertaken so as to have the most accurate and up-to-date information on scene location and their current state of conservation. For the transfer of knowledge and dissemination of the results, the project's website (www.wineofancientegypt.com) has been developed to present information about the project, team members, publications, news, links, collaborations and contacts. The website will also include all the collected data, studies and analysis. The on-line access to the scene-detail and bibliographic databases, and to the geo-referenced tomb map is currently being developed. This research study on viticulture and winemaking scenes in ancient Egyptian private tombs is an important tool for the future documentation and conservation of the archaeological heritage of Egypt. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

955.html,Wedjat-eyes as a dating criterion for false doors and stelae to the early Middle Kingdom,"The significance of the wedjat-eyes as a motif in the Egyptian funerary repertoire has its origins in the mythology of Horus and Seth. After Thoth was able to restore Horus's left eye, which was lost in a battle with Seth, it came to symbolise healing, renewal and the general process of making 'whole' again. Carol Andrews comments that the eyes became 'essential elements' of the tomb. They came to decorate both the interior and exterior of coffins, providing a portal for the deceased to look out of, as well as false doors and stelae. The development of the wedjat-eyes on these various components of the tomb's architecture and equipment, in particular their placement, provides an interesting criterion for dating and one which has not been adequately examined before. While various scholars have contributed important observations to the subject, this paper will bring together all known examples of false doors and stelae bearing the wedjat-eyes motif up until the early Middle Kingdom in order to provide a detailed comparative and holistic analysis of their significance for dating. Specifically, it will examine the origins of the motif and its relationship to coffin decoration from the late 6th Dynasty at Saqqara, their frequency and distribution across nome sites, as well as their development on the inner jambs, central niche and crossbar. The paper will further show how new and refined dates can be proposed for individual false doors and stelae based on this type of analysis. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

The architectural investigation,"This paper presents the latest results of the ongoing research on the temple of Ramesses II at Antinoe. The goal is to identify the stages of the building life-cycle, through the study of its original formal and technological characters and subsequent transformations. Complete plans and elevations of extant remains have been drafted. The positions of the wall structures, now disappeared, have been highlighted by the mapping of the floors. Stratigraphic investigations and analysis of the materials have been carried out on the columns of the court and the hypostyle hall. Standard formal models and main technological processes have been identified, as well as specific solutions. Attention has been paid to the study of mortars and painting layers, especially with the analysis of pigments used in different decoration phases. The systematic recording of the scattered pieces (capitals, architraves, cornices, talatats) is leading to significant knowledge of the collapsed parts of the building. Some hypotheses on the original appearance of entablatures and colonnades may be proposed. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

This determines a well-defined wind dynamics at surface levels. Although this weather event—mainly recorded in spring and summer—coincides with the flowering season of many wind pollinated species, its potential influence on long term airborne pollen transport has been not investigated in detail. We analyse their influence on olive pollen transport at surface level in south Spain. Daily and bi-hourly olive pollen data from 2010 to 2015, recorded at two sites 150 km apart, Málaga (coast) and Córdoba (inland), were analysed together with 1) air masses at 300 m above ground level (m.a.g.l.), 2) surface wind direction and 3) surface wind speed over the same period. Air masses at 3000 m.a.g.l. were used to identify the periods under the influence of African intrusions. The combined analysis has enabled the identification of different pollen patterns and source contributions. In Málaga, hourly pollen peaks were recorded during the early morning coinciding with the arrival of north-westerly winds (developing sea-land breezes), with a minimal impact of local pollen sources; in Córdoba, by contrast, pollen concentrations reflected the joint contribution of local and long term sources, being the maximum concentrations associated with the arrival of southerly air masses in the afternoon. These results help to understand the potential distant sources and back-trajectories of olive pollen detected. In our case pollen from sources located at the west-northwest areas in the case of Malaga, and from the south in Cordoba. These results reinforce the idea that combined studies between synoptic meteorological and aerobiological data together with different atmospheric height air masses data, offer us a better explanation and understanding of the behaviour and the potential sources of recorded airborne data in a given place. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",-,Department of Botany\Ecology and Plant Physiology\Spain; European Commission\Joint Research Centre (JRC)\Italy; Departament of Plant Science\University of Málaga\Spain,-,African intrusions; Backward trajectories; HYSPLIT; Olea europaea; Olive pollen; Saharan intrusions
960.html,In the footsteps of Ricardo Caminos: Rediscovering the 'Speos of Gebel el Silsila',"Though long admired for its Pharaonic stelae, shrines, and rock-cut temple, the grand ancient site of Gebel el Silsila remains fairly unknown within mainstream archaeology. A general idea is that the site operated merely as a sandstone quarry, but few are aware of its rich archaeology that incorporates evidence of millennia of human activity and cultural features that meet seven of UNESCO's ten outstanding values. Since 2012 the Swedish-run archaeological project works towards changing previous misconceptions, and in conducting a comprehensive archaeological study the aim is to increase the general awareness of the site's importance and unique legacy. 'In the footsteps of Ricardo Caminos' is aimed to present an introduction to previous work conducted within the 'Speos of Horemheb', how limitations of the past now can be bridged with more modern technology, and how the current team implement novel documentation and results to the field of epigraphy within one of Gebel el Silsila's more famous monuments. The results ultimately force back the chronology of the rock-cut temple from post-Amarna to the Thutmosid period. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

961.html,The career of Nakhtmin (TT 87) as revealed by his funerary cones,"In this paper, I discuss Nakhtmin, the owner of Theban tomb TT 87, who was active during the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. Examining his six types of funerary cones revealed that the tomb was not his only tomb, that he had had another one in the Khokhah area before he constructed TT 87. The question then arises as to why he constructed TT 87 at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna area even though he already had one (which is now missing). I suggest the unexpected promotion to Overseer of the Double Granaries in Upper and Lower Egypt caused him to construct the new one to reflect his new social position. This idea is mainly backed up by his two shrines at Gebel es-Silsila. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

962.html,"The folding cubit rod of Kha in Museo Egizio di Torino, S.839","Much may be inferred about item S.8391, a folding cubit rod that belonged to Kha (TT 8, 18th Dynasty), by analyzing the results of the measurement survey conducted in 2011 from the perspective of woodwork. When Schiaparelli discovered the rod, it was folded inside a leather bag with a strap. The extremely rare folding cubit rod was loved by Kha, who was the overseer of works in Deir el-Medina and its related sites, where it was in practical use. This rod folds in half with a simple bronze hinge at the center; there are absolutely no inscriptions. The carved tally marks are only rough divisions into palms and the digits, and compared with other rods, the cubit measure is somewhat long, so the rod's precision was in doubt. However, a metrological argument concerning the differences in the values of the palms and digits is proposed based on the presumed manner in which the wooden rod was created and actually used. The rod's total length is 527.6mm, not greatly different from that reported by Senigalliesi in 1961. The size of each measurement interval, which Senigalliesi did not report, suggests how the rod was made. The tally marks are fine white lines; the left-hand palm is 75mm long, which is the common measurement of one palm, subdivided into four digits that vary little in size. Taking this into account, it is unthinkable that the makers lacked the ability to make tally marks accurately. The variations of values were supposedly caused by the process of creating the hinge. The center interval, including the hinge, is especially small, at (36mm + 36mm =) 72mm. For example, if we assume a play of about 3mm, a commonly used value, the center interval would become 36mm + 36mm + 3mm = 75mm. The inclination of the lines and the variations in size indicate that tally marks were etched in the closed position. S.8391 can also be used as a half-cubit measure in a closed position, and the first palm on the left side can measure digits. Traces of trial and error in remaking the hinge were found. In this study, I discovered that the clever hinge that makes this cubit rod possible satisfies two contradictory requirements to realize this rare folding rod. The appearance of this folding cubit rod, with no inscriptions and purely functional design, shows that it took incalculable effort to make it a prized instrument for the owner. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

963.html,The pre-Egyptological concept of Egypt as a challenge for Egyptology and the efforts to establish a research community,"The pre-Egyptological concept of Egypt is a fascinating research field with a lot of topics involved and a huge quantity of research literature. It is almost impossible to survey the entire research field. There is no proper introduction, no handbook, not even a bibliography or a periodical. Even worse, there is no coherent scientific discussion or clearly recognizable research community. The research field seems to be very appealing on the one hand and absolutely shapeless on the other. In this paper I will present one of the projects aimed to change this situation at establishing a research community and launching proper research tools. To clarify the challenges of this project I will first give an overview of the research history and a rough sketch of the current research.

964.html,Basic considerations on the construction of pyramids in the Old Kingdom,"Given that the lower third of a pyramid contains about 70% of the stone blocks, the only efficient way of reducing building time at the minimum is a method which allows for upward transport of material from all four sides simultaneously. Ramps positioned tangentially with a slope of 26° come to mind. The time required for upward transport of blocks significantly influences the total building time. By comparison, the production of blocks in the quarry as well as their transport to the building site and horizontal transfer on the respective level would have been far less challenging as more workforce would have been available. In the model presented here, upward pulling of blocks on horizontal rollers is accomplished by letting workers move downwards on the other side of the ramp. After completion of the stepped core, the ramps are removed, and the casing, which consists of horizontal courses, is laid. For this, a stepped auxiliary platform and tangential ramps are used. Thus, it is possible to set the pyramidion and subsequently polish the exterior face top down without significant danger, while also removing the auxiliary platform. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

They were discovered in the Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, and Europe. They were usually imported from Egyptian workshops, but it seems that a great number of shabtis were also crafted outside Egypt in various cultic centres of Isis, Osiris and Serapis. Egyptologists commonly classified these type of shabtis as 'fakes', but they had to be considered as 'ancient copies' of the original Egyptian artefacts (Aegyptiaca). In this paper author will present the group of shabtis (39) which were discovered in various archaeological sites in Istria, Dalmatia and Pannonia, their collections, and typology. These shabtis can be dated from the early Third Intermediate Period (10th century BC) to the Roman period. The biggest group was discovered around ancient Salona (today Solin, Croatia) and the central Dalmatian islands, where the ancient Greek settlements were established from the late 6th century BC.

Among them, several artefacts of a king's son of the 17th Dynasty, Intefmose, have been found. He was known until now by three documents, all of them lacking an archaeological context: 1) a seated headless statue, found reused by Petrie in Qurna, close to the area of TT 11-12, and now in Manchester (inv. no. 5051); 2) a fragmentary shabti of the British Museum (inv. no. 13329) mentioning him and a king called Sobekemsaf, possibly Sobekemsaf II; and 3) a shabti coffin. The corpus of documents of Intefmose can now be increased thanks to the new findings in the area of TT 11-12, pertaining to his burial assemblage and offering place of this royal person. The context and content of this evidence can add some interesting facts, such as the almost certain location of the tomb of Intefmose in the area of TT 11-12 and the possible existence of a posthumous cult after his death. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

However, the mechanism on how sulfate-rich mine drainage affects freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown, and its potential ecological risk has not been assessed so far. During 2009–2016, water and macroinvertebrate samples from 405 sample sites were collected along the mine drainage gradient from circum-neutral to alkaline waters in Hun-Tai River, Northeastern China. Results of linear regressions showed that sulfate-rich mine drainage was significantly positively correlated with the constituents typically derived from rock weathering (Ca2 +, Mg2 +and HCO3–+ CO32 −); the diversity of intolerant stream macroinvertebrates exhibited a steep decline along the gradient of sulfate-rich mine drainage. Meanwhile, stressor-response relationships between sulfate-rich mine drainage and macroinvertebrate communities were explored by two complementary statistical approaches in tandem (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and the field-based method developed by USEPA). Results revealed that once stream sulfate concentrations in mine drainage exceeded 35 mg/L, significant decline in the abundance of intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occurred. An assessment of ecological risk posed by sulfate-rich mine drainage was conducted based on a tiered approach consisting of simple deterministic method (Hazard Quotient, HQ) to probabilistic method (Joint Probability Curve, JPC). Results indicated that sulfate-rich mine drainage posed a potential risk, and 64.62–84.88% of surface waters in Hun-Tai River exist serious risk while 5% threshold (HC05) and 1% threshold (HC01) were set up to protect macroinvertebrates, respectively. This study provided us a better understanding on the impacts of sulfate-rich mine drainage on freshwater ecosystems, and it would be helpful for future catchment management to protect streams from mining activity. © 2017",Zhao Qian; Guo Fen; Zhang Yuan; Ma Shuqin; Jia Xiaobo; Meng Wei,College of Water Science\Beijing Normal University\China; State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment\Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences\China; Laboratory of Riverine Ecological Conservation and Technology\Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences\China,-,Ecological risk assessment; Hun-Tai River; Macroinvertebrates; Mining activity; Sulfate-rich mine drainage
970.html,The Stelae Ridge cairns: A reassessment of the archaeological evidence,"This paper presents the archaeological evidence for a new model of the development of eight cairns across two ridges at the Stelae Ridge ritual site, in the Middle Kingdom carnelian mining region of the same name. Based on a new interpretation of the archaeological and textual evidence from the site, this paper proposes that the first round cairn was constructed as a landmark, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, for travellers approaching the mining area, and/or some small carnelian mines actually on Stelae Ridge itself. Perhaps attracted by debris from the mines and the presence of an existing cairn, the first of seven ritual cairn-courts was constructed, adjacent to the original round cairn, during the co-regency of Amenemhat 1st and Senusret 1st in the early 12th Dynasty. This was followed by a sequence of cairn-courts running northwards across Stelae Ridge until early in the reign of Amenemhat 3rd, when the last four cairn-courts were built in the only remaining space around the periphery of the two ridges. The construction of the cairn-courts may have been facilitated by the quarrying of local stone from Stelae Ridge, perhaps exploiting former mines that were already present on the site. Mining may even have continued on Stelae Ridge north, even as the first two cairn-courts were constructed on the southern ridge. At some point, probably not much later than year 13 of Amenemhat 3rd, cairn construction either ceased entirely as the mining region was abandoned, or moved to other ridges in the area. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

By creating as detailed as possible object biographies from the time of production of the objects in ancient Egypt over the moment of collection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries AD to modern reception and understanding, the biographies have to focus on the ancient Egyptian life-cycle of these unprovenanced objects as well as the (modern) narrative in which we are embedding them by using archaeological and anthropological theory. Following the contesting meanings and several identities of these ancient Egyptian objects - and several replicas from the late 19th and early 20th centuries AD - the urgency to deal with heritage becomes clear, be it 'our' or world heritage, tangible or intangible. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

972.html,The Min Project. First working seasons on the unpublished Tomb of Min (TT109) and Tomb Kampp -327-: The Tomb of May and a replica of the Tomb of Osiris,"The Canarian-Tuscan Archaeological Mission, in Cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry of State for Antiquities, obtained the concession to explore two tombs in the area of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, Luxor: Tomb TT109 (the Tomb of Min) and Tomb Kampp -327-, whose owner is still unknown. The tombs are both unpublished (except for a brief article by P. Virey in 1887 on the Tomb of Min) and present scenes and architecture of interest. The Tomb of Min dates back to the 18th Dynasty, specifically to the reign of Thutmosis III. Min held an important position in the court of the Pharaoh, since he was chosen to be tutor to the prince, the future King Amenhotep II. The decoration of the Tomb of Min is analyzed, as well as particular aspects of its architecture, which can be seen in few other Theban tombs. Tomb Kampp -327-concealed not only a tunnel in one of its walls that led to the discovery of a new tomb, belonging to May (senior official of the 18th Dynasty), but also a complex and unique structure: A tomb that seems to evoke the legendary Tomb of Osiris, containing elements that can be found in the monumental tombs of the Late Period (25th-26th Dynasties) present in the Assasif area of Luxor. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

973.html,"Hierakonpolis Faience, 2005-2013, with context and accompanying finds - a quest for chronology and possible use","Our recent excavations at the Temple-Town Hierakonpolis have been fortunate to find faience figurines and related objects with accompanying evidence important to context and chronology. Most comparable figurines are known from two temple sites: Abydos and Elephantine. Hierakonpolis provides the first secular context, north in the ancient town. The date of these figurines has been an open question. According to stratigraphic evidence from the Satet Temple at Elephantine, the numerous figurines can be as late as the 5th Dynasty. Hierakonpolis faience found in 1978 trial trenches, led to the 1981 excavations of quadrant 15n8w and the resultant faience figurines published in the preliminary report. Faience has not been common in the temple or town of ancient Hierakonpolis, but a surprisingly dense area of fragments has been found in the northwest and continues the 1981 group. Recent evidence from Hierakonpolis, 2005-2013 seasons, have clarified architecture and fortunately retrieved context for the faience in the northwest part of the ancient town. Each occupational stratum found in 2005 and 2006 is interrelated in finds and consistent in pottery. The 2005-2013 pottery and tapered palette (Inv. 2005-2) not only confirm occupation belonging to Naqada III to the 1st Dynasty, c. 3200-3000 BC but also provide for the first time a date for the Hierakonpolis faience. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

976.html,Effect of mixed valence states of platinum ion dopants on the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide under visible light irradiation,"Titanium dioxide doped with the Pt ion (Pt− TiO2) was synthesized by a sol−gel method using only water as the solvent and conducting dialysis. The photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) on Pt− TiO2was not affected by the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller specific surface area under visible light (VL) irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements revealed that only the Pt(IV) ion existed in the TiO2bulk and both Pt(II) and Pt(IV) were present near the Pt−TiO2surface. Pt(IV) is most likely substituted in the Ti(IV) site of the TiO2lattice because of their similar ionic sizes. Quantitative analysis of Pt(II) was performed in the XPS measurements, indicating that the amount of Pt(II) on the surface increased with an increase in the doping amount from 0.2 to 1.0 atom %. We synthesized 0.5 atom % Pt−TiO2with various Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios by changing the Ti(OC3H7)4concentration used in the sol−gel synthesis. The 4-CP conversion on Pt−TiO2increased linearly with an increase in the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratios. A similar relationship was obtained with Pt−TiO2, which was prepared by a conventional sol−gel method in ethanol−water mixed solvent. Therefore, the Pt(II)/Pt(IV) ratio is a key factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Pt−TiO2under VL irradiation. Our results indicate that controlling the mixed valence states of the doped metal ions is a new strategy to developing highly active metal-ion-doped TiO2under VL irradiation. © 2017 American Chemical Society",Nishiyama Naoto; Yamazaki Suzuko,Division of Environmental Science and Engineering\Graduate School of Science and Engineering\United States; Division of Earth Science\Biology\Japan,-,-
977.html,Effect of differential self-assembly on mechanochromic luminescence of fluorene-benzothiadiazole-based fluorophores,"Supramolecular self-assembly is an excellent tool for controlling the optical and electronic properties of chromophore-based molecular systems. Herein, we demonstrate how differential self-assembly affects mechanoresponsive luminescence of fluorene-benzothiadiazole-based fluorophores. We have synthesized two donor−acceptor− donor-type conjugated oligomers consisting of fluorene as the donor and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor. For facile self-assembly, both molecules are end-functionalized with hydrogen-bonding amide groups. Differential self-assembly was induced by attaching alkyl chains of different lengths onto the fluorene moiety: hexyl (FB-C6) and dodecyl (FB-C12). The molecules self-assemble to form well-defined nanostructures in nonpolar solvents and solvent mixtures. Although their optical properties in solution are not affected by the alkyl chain length, significant effects were observed in the self-assembled state, particularly in the excitation energy migration properties. As a result, remarkable differences were observed in the mechanochromic luminescence properties of the molecules. A precise structure− property correlation is made using UV−visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy time-correlated single-photon counting analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. © 2017 American Chemical Society",Naeem Karattu Chali; Neenu Kadaikkara; Nair Vijayakumar C.,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR)\CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST)\India,-,-
978.html,Anion complexation studies of 3‑nitrophenyl-substituted tripodal thiourea receptor: A naked-eye detection of sulfate via fluoride displacement assay,"A thiourea-based tripodal receptor L substituted with 3-nitrophenyl groups has been synthesized, and the binding affinity for a variety of anions has been studied by1H NMR titrations and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. As investigated by1H NMR titrations, the receptor binds an anion in a 1:1 binding mode, showing the highest binding and strong selectivity for sulfate anion. A competitive colorimetric assay in the presence of fluoride suggests that the sulfate is capable of displacing the bound fluoride, showing a sharp visible color change. The strong affinity of L for sulfate was further supported by UV−vis titrations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Time-dependent DFT calculations indicate that the fluoride complex possesses a different optical absorption spectrum (due to charge transfer between the fluoride and the surrounding ligand) than the sulfate complex, reflecting the observed colorimetric change in these two complexes. The receptor was further tested for its biocompatibility on primary human foreskin fibroblasts and HeLa cells, exhibiting an excellent cell viability up to 100 μM concentration. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Khansari Maryam Emami; Hasan Mohammad H.; Johnson Corey R.; Williams Nya A.; Wong Bryan M.; Powell Douglas R.; Tandon Ritesh; Hossain Alamgir,Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry\Jackson State University\United States; Department of Microbiology and Immunology\University of Mississippi Medical Center\United States; Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering Program\University of CaliforniaRiverside\United States; Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry\University of Oklahoma\United States,-,-
979.html,Macroporous gel with a permeable reaction platform for catalytic flow synthesis,"We mimic a living system wherein target molecules permeate through capillary and cells for chemical transformation. A monolithic porous gel (MPG) was easily prepared by copolymerization of gel matrix, tertiary amine, and cross-linking monomer in one-step synthesis. Interconnected capillaries existed in the MPG, enabling flow application with high permeability. Because the capillaries were constituted of polymer gel, Pd(0)-loaded MPG provided another permeable pathway to substrates in a gel network, contributing to its much high turnover number after 30 days of use, compared with that of Pd(0)-loaded inorganic supports. Interestingly, the gel network size of the MPG influenced the catalytic frequency. Diffusivities of the substrates and product in the gel networks increased with increasing network sizes in relation to catalytic activities. The MPG strategy provides a universal reactor design in conjunction with a practical process and precisely controlled reaction platform. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Matsumoto Hikaru; Seto Hirokazu; Akiyoshi Takanori; Shibuya Makoto; Hoshino Yu; Miura Yoshiko,Department of Chemical Engineering\Kyushu University\Japan; Department of Chemical Engineering\Fukuoka University\Japan,-,-
98.html,Theoretical prediction of robust and intrinsic half-metallicity in Ni2N MXene with different types of surface terminations,"Three MXenes, namely Fe2N, Co2N, and Ni2N in both bare and surface-passivated forms were investigated theoretically using density functional theory. Fe2N(OH)2, Fe2NO2, Co2NO2, Ni2NF2, Ni2N(OH)2, and Ni2NO2are found to be intrinsic half-metals, while other structures have antiferromagnetic ground states. Notably, the half-metallicity of Ni2NT2(T = F, OH, and O) does not depend on the type of surface terminations. This is interesting because the synthesized MXenes usually have mixed surface terminations of F, OH, and O. The half-metallic band gaps calculated with the HSE06 hybrid density functional are 2.03, 1.81, and 1.01 eV, respectively. This implies that thermally induced spin flip should be suppressed. The ferromagnetic coupling between Ni atoms is explained by a superexchange interaction mechanism mediated by spin polarized N atoms. Based on the Heisenberg model, large intra- and inter-layer exchange parameters were obtained. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the Curie temperatures of Ni2NF2, Ni2N(OH)2, and Ni2NO2are 1800, 2400, and 3300 K respectively, all much higher than room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations also indicate that the ferromagnetic Ni2NT2compounds are stable at room temperature. Therefore, we predict that the half-metallicity of Ni2NT2should be relatively easy to be achieved and Ni2NT2is a good candidate for spintronics.                          © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Wang Guo; Liao Yi,Department of Chemistry\Capital Normal University\China,-,Density functional theory; Half-metal; MXene; Room temperature; Surface termination

The synthesized catalyst has been employed to reduce toxic Cr(VI) and degrade phenol from the aqueous solution. The structural, optical, and electrochemical characterizations are performed using X-ray diffraction, UV−vis diffuse reflection, photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The optical properties were precisely investigated by calculating the Urbach energy, PL, and photoluminescence excitation spectra. The orderly distribution of QDs is confirmed from the correlation between full width at half-maximum of PL spectra Urbach energy and TEM analysis. The versatile photocatalytic activity has been tested toward Cr(VI) reduction and degradation of phenol. 3% CdS QDs-sensitized self-doped Bi2MoO6showed highest activity, i.e., 97 and 47.5% toward reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol under solar light. The reduction of Cr(VI) by the catalyst is supported by the kinetics and determination of the pHPZCvalue. In addition to this, the photostability and reusability test showed that the catalyst can be reused up to five cycles without diminishing its activity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Kandi Debasmita; Martha Satyabadi; Thirumurugan Arun,Centre for Nano Science and Nano Technology\Institute of Technical Education and Research\India; Advanced Material Laboratory\Department of Mechanical Engineering\Chile,-,-

It was found that the generation of an Ni phase in an NiOxlayer was significantly suppressed by employing cesium. Furthermore, Cs-incorporated NiOxenabled holes to be efficiently separated at the interface, showing the improved photoluminescent quenching and thus generating higher short-circuit current. The effect of Cs incorporation was also prominent in the inhibition of recombination. The recombination resistance of Cs-incorporated NiOxwas noticeably increased by more than three-fold near the maximum power point leading to a higher fill factor of 0.78 and consequently a higher power conversion efficiency of 17.2% for the device employing Cs-incorporated NiOx. © 2017 American Chemical Society",Kim Hui-Seon; Seo Ji-Youn; Xie Haibing; Lira-Cantu Monica; Zakeeruddin Shaik M.; Gratzel Michael; Hagfeldt Anders,Laboratory of Photomolecular Science\Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering\United States; Laboratory for Photonics and Interfaces\Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering\Switzerland; Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)\CSIC\Spain,-,-
982.html,Enhancement of polarization in ferroelectric films via the incorporation of gold nanoparticles,"Ferroelectric thin films have been extremely studied for many applications such as nonvolatile memories, super capacitors, and solar cells. For these devices, improving the polarization properties of ferroelectric thin films is of great significance to their performance. Here, Au−lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanocomposite thin films were prepared by a simple one-step chemical solution deposition (CSD) method on silicon substrates, and the effects of Au concentration on the ferroelectric properties were investigated. The experimental results show that the remanent polarization of the Au−PZT films with 1.2 mol % Au is about 80 μC/cm2, which is 50% higher than that of the pure PZT thin films. On the basis of the analysis of chemical valences, the enhanced polarization properties can be ascribed to the interaction between Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) and PZT at the Au− PZT interfaces. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of Au NPs is an effective way to enhance the polarization properties of ferroelectric films. The Au−PZT nanocomposite thin films with excellent polarization properties on silicon substrates are expected to be widely used in integrated ferroelectric devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Bai Yu; Wang Zhan Jie; He Bin; Cui Jian Zhong; Zhang Zhi Dong,School of Materials Science and Engineering\Northeastern University\China; Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science\Institute of Metal Research\China; School of Material Science and Engineering\Shenyang University of Technology\China,-,-
983.html,Simultaneous hardening/ductilizing effects of cryogenic nanohybridization of biopolyamides with montmorillonites,"We prepared organic/inorganic bionanohybrid resins of polyamides containing pyrrolidone in the backbone derived from the salt monomers of an itaconic acid biomolecule with various nanofillers, montmorillonites (MMTs), by cryogenic nanohybridizations. The nanohybridizations with MMTs hardened and strengthened the polypyrrolidone bioplastic resins owing to a simple reinforcement of hard filler incorporation. On the other hand, the elongation at break of the resins is unexpectedly increased by the nanohybridization with MMT sodium salt (NaMMT) to enhance the strain energy density, which differed from those of the nanohybrids with other organically modified MMTs. From spectroscopic analyses, we discuss the mechanism of such ductilization effects by NaMMT, the catalytic effect of NaMMT on partially opening the pyrrolidone ring to make polymer backbones flexible and to form carboxyl side chains that are strongly interactive with NaMMT fillers. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Ali Mohammad Asif; Tandon Nupur; Kaneko Tatsuo,Energy and Environment Area\Graduate School of Advanced Science and Technology\Japan,-,-
984.html,Engineered (Lys)6‑tagged recombinant sulfide-reactive hemoglobin I for covalent immobilization at multiwalled carbon nanotubes,"The recombinant HbI was fused with a poly-Lys tag ((Lys)6-tagged rHbI) for specific-site covalent immobilization on two carbon nanotube transducer surfaces, i.e., powder and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. The immobilization was achieved by following two steps: (1) generation of amine-reactive ester from the carboxylic acid groups of the surfaces and (2) coupling these groups with the amine groups of the Lys-tag. We analyzed the immobilization process using different conditions and techniques to differentiate protein covalent attachment from physical adsorption. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy data showed a 14 cm−1displacement of the protein’s amide I and amide II peaks to lower the frequency after immobilization. This result indicates a covalent attachment of the protein to the surface. Differences in the morphology of the carbon substrate with and without (Lys)6-tagged rHbI confirmed protein immobilization, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical studies which were performed to evaluate the redox center of the immobilized protein, show a confinement suitable for an efficient electron transfer system. More importantly, the electrochemical studies allowed determination of a redox potential for the new (Lys)6-tagged rHbI. The data show that the protein is electrochemically active and retains its biological activity toward H2S. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Díaz-Ayala Ramonita; Torres-Gonzalez Lisa; Pietri Ruth; Cabrera Carlos R.; Lopez-Garriga Juan,Department of Chemistry\University of Puerto RicoMayagüez Campus\Puerto Rico; Department of Chemistry\University of Puerto RicoRío Piedras Campus\Puerto Rico; Department of Chemistry\University of Puerto RicoCayey Campus\Puerto Rico,-,-
985.html,"Aqueous-solution-processed Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4thin-film solar cells via an improved successive ion-layer-adsorption∑reaction sequence","A facile improved successive ionic-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) sequence is described for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4(CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) via the selenization of a precursor film. The precursor films were fabricated using a modified SILAR sequence to overcome compositional inhomogeneity due to different adsorptivities of the cations (Cu+, Sn4+, and Zn2+) in a single cationic bath. Rapid thermal annealing of the precursor films under S and Se vapor atmospheres led to the formation of carbon-free Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS) and CZTSSe absorber layers, respectively, with single large-grained layers. The best devices based on CZTS and CZTSSe absorber layers showed total area (∼0.30 cm2) power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.96 and 3.74%, respectively, which are notably the first-demonstrated efficiencies using a modified SILAR sequence. Detailed diode analyses of these solar cells revealed that a high shunt conductance (Gsh), reverse saturation current density (Jo), and ideality factor (nd) significantly affected the PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), whereas the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was dominated by the series resistance (Rs) and Gsh. However, the diode analyses combined with the compositional and interface microstructural analyses shed light on further improvements to the device efficiency. The facile layer-by-layer growth of the kesterite CZTS-based thin films in aqueous solution provides a great promise as an environmentally benign pathway to fabricate a variety of multielement-component compounds with high compositional homogeneities. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Suryawanshi Mahesh P.; Ghorpade Uma V.; Suryawanshi Umesh P.; He Mingrui; Kim Jihun; Gang Myeng Gil; Patil Pramod S.; Moholkar Annasaheb V.; Yun Jae Ho; Kim Jin Hyeok,Optoelectronics Convergence Research Center\Department of Materials Science and Engineering\South Korea; Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology\Cheomdangwagi-ro\South Korea; Thin Film Nanomaterials Laboratory\Department of Physics\India; Photovoltaic Laboratory\Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER)\South Korea,-,-
986.html,Roles of active-site aromatic residues in cold adaptation of sphingomonas glacialis esterase EstSP1,"The aromatic amino acids, Tyr or Trp, which line the active-site walls of esterases, stabilize the catalytic His loop via hydrogen bonding. A Tyr residue is preferred in extremophilic esterases (psychrophilic or hyperthermophilic esterases), whereas a Trp residue is preferred in moderate-temperature esterases. Here, we provide evidence that Tyr and Trp play distinct roles in cold adaptation of the psychrophilic esterase EstSP1 isolated from an Arctic bacterium Sphingomonas glacialis PAMC 26605. Stern−Volmer plots showed that the mutation of Tyr191 to Ala, Phe, Trp, and His resulted in reduced conformational flexibility of the overall protein structure. Interestingly, the Y191W and Y191H mutants showed increased thermal stability at moderate temperatures. All Tyr191 mutants showed reduced catalytic activity relative to wild-type EstSP1. Our results indicate that Tyr with its phenyl hydroxyl group is favored for increased conformational flexibility and high catalytic activity of EstSP1 at low temperatures at the expense of thermal stability. The results of this study suggest that, in the permanently cold Arctic zone, enzyme activity has been selected for psychrophilic enzymes over thermal stability. The results presented herein provide novel insight into the roles of Tyr and Trp residues for temperature adaptation of enzymes that function at low, moderate, and high temperatures. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Kashif Ayesha; Tran Lan-Huong; Jang Sei-Heon; Lee ChangWoo,Department of Biomedical Science\Center for Bio-Nanomaterials\South Korea,-,-
987.html,Plurality as a form of (Mis)management of international dispute settlement: Afterword to Laurence Boisson de Chazournes' Foreword,"In 'Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals: The Threads of a Managerial Approach', Laurence Boisson de Chazournes maps out the variety of legal doctrines and communicative devices that allow international courts to navigate the course of international dispute settlement in ways that avert serious jurisdictional or jurisprudential clashes between different international courts. This reply is largely supportive of Boisson de Chazournes' account of an evolving judicial 'managerial approach'. It questions, however, whether international courts are truly committed to a 'managerial approach' and whether such an approach is likely to succeed in the long run without a structural redesign of the 'fabric of international dispute settlement'. Section 2 of the Afterword discusses jurisdictional plurality as a deliberate choice by states, which is likely to restrict the coherence of international law. Section 3 discusses the dilemmas facing international courts: the choice of a pro-coherence 'management approach' may conflict with other mandated functions, including providing the litigating parties with cost-effective dispute settlement services and supporting the particular needs of the legal regimes in which they are embedded. Section 4 concludes. © The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd. All rights reserved.",Shany Yuval,Faculty of Law\Hebrew University\Israel,-,-
988.html,Liability to international prosecution: The nature of universal jurisdiction,"This article considers the proper method for theorizing about criminal jurisdiction. It challenges a received understanding of how to substantiate the right to punish and articulates an alternative account of how that theoretical task is properly conducted. The received view says that a special relationship is the ground of a tribunal's authority to prosecute and, hence, that a normative theory of that authority is faced with identifying a distinctive relation. The alternative account locates prosecutorial standing on an institution's capacity to address the basic reasons generating criminal liability. This reframes the normative issues at stake and has the result that various, perhaps quite heterogeneous, considerations can substantiate penal authority. It also eliminates the existence of a special relation as a necessary condition for legitimate criminal accountability. The argument proceeds by offering an analysis and account of universal jurisdiction. Not only does the alternative elegantly perform where the received view struggles, it can accommodate much of what motivates the pursuit of relational ties in existing efforts to vindicate jurisdictional conclusions. © The Author(s), 2018.

Overcoming the various obstacles requires not only clarifying rules and relationships (exante specification) but also adding mechanisms that effectively accommodate interests while limiting pitfalls and contributing to calibrating adjudicatory authority (ex-post control). Such additional tools may help to control the tribunals' ability to make and apply their decisions. They also can serve to relieve the international law processes from the pressures exerted by excessive legal 'experimentalism'. Among the most obvious of such tools emerging in international economic agreements are consolidation or joint decision-making provisions, stays and under-ride processes, interaction requirements or special delegation arrangements. © The Author(s), 2018.

991.html,The threads (or threats?) of a managerial approach: Afterword to Laurence Boisson de Chazournes' Foreword,"In her EJIL Foreword article, Boisson de Chazournes gives an optimistic account of the proliferation of international courts and tribunals. She argues that the proliferation has been a constant and desired feature of international dispute settlement and that problems arising from it can be resolved through 'internal communication' among judicial bodies and through various procedural rules preventing jurisdictional overlaps. These tools, richly illustrated by numerous examples primarily from the area of international economic law, attest, in the author's view, to the emergence of a new, managerial approach. In my Afterword, I consider what this managerial approach consists of and how it relates to the other 'managerial theories' known in international law-the managerial model of Abram Chayes and Antonia Handler Chayes and managerialism described by Martti Koskenniemi. I argue that the managerial approach is close to the former theory and, as such, is also vulnerable to the reservations raised against it (formalism, excessive optimism). I further argue that the managerial approach is not identical to managerialism but that the article, placing so much emphasis on formal, procedural rules, might not do enough to prevent the confusion between the two. © The Author(s), 2018.

The article depicts why a private regulator and an international organization would cooperate and what this tells us about the relationship between 'expertise', 'power' and 'legitimacy' within global governance. Two arguments are put forward and developed in the article. First, regulators cooperate because, in an unsettled global space with no hierarchical framework, cooperation is necessary for them to acquire sufficient authority to secure compliance with their regulatory agenda; cooperation opens a venue for the exchange of necessary regulatory resources and, thus, ultimately helps regulators establish and strengthen their authority. Second, because of the rate of recurrence of regulatory cooperation on a global scale, the article calls for the integration of the concept of regulatory cooperation into international law scholarship to help recognize and formalize this practice. It aims to encourage a debate about the risks and benefits involved in these regulatory interactions and about a (legal) framework that could safeguard important public policy interests. © The Author(s), 2018.

994.html,Rights under international humanitarian law,"The idea of 'rights' under the law of war historically referred to state or belligerent rights-that is, rights to engage in actions not permitted under the law of peace. The different sense of rights of individuals was absent from those traditional accounts of the law, and whether individuals are granted rights (for example, of prisoners of war to be humanely treated, of civilians not to be targeted) under contemporary international humanitarian law (IHL) remains contested. This article explores how this debate has developed in recent history. It argues that clear support for the notion of individual rights during the drafting of the 1907 Hague Convention IV and subsequent treaties seemed to be overtaken by state practice in the area of war reparations, only to re-emerge in more recent practice that, in part, is shown to be a result of a more legalized approach to the invocation of responsibility for IHL violations. This growing support for the individual rights perspective of IHL is then juxtaposed with the re-emergence of state rights. The article concludes that these two different notions of 'rights' under IHL present two fundamentally opposing visions for the law's role in regulating armed conflict. © The Author(s), 2018.

995.html,Experimenting with International Law,"A growing body of experimental research has begun to explore the causal mechanisms through which international law impacts behaviour. International legal scholars, however, are still in the early stages of adopting experimental methods. Indeed, Yahli Shereshevsky and Tom Noah's article is one of the first experimental studies to appear in the European Journal of International Law. Its publication thus provides an opportunity to reflect not only on this pioneering work but also on the broader 'experimental turn' in the study of international law. To do so, we begin by motivating the experimental turn, which we argue reflects both a methodological shift from observational studies towards the increasing use of experiments and a theoretical shift from rational choice towards cognitive psychology and behavioural economics. Second, we engage in a critical reading of Shereshevsky and Noah's study of the impact of preparatory materials on treaty interpretation. Applying the dual criteria of internal and external validity, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of Shereshevsky and Noah's study. We conclude that experiments promise to extend our knowledge of international law and are likely to become increasingly influential in scholarly and policy debates. Hence, all international lawyers have an urgent interest in becoming knowledgeable and critical consumers of experimental research. © The Author(s), 2018.

997.html,Reflections on role responsibility: The responsibility of international organizations for failing to act,"This article investigates whether international organizations can be held responsible under international law when they fail to act. It aims to conceptualize the notion of 'omission' in the international law on the responsibility of international organizations and does so in four broad steps. First, a discussion of the most well-known failure (the United Nations' refusal to intervene in the Rwandan genocide in 1994) suggests that there is a need to conceptualize the omission and to reflect on the sort of factors that may cause a failure to act. Second, the article investigates how omissions have been addressed in the literature and in the codification of the law on responsibility and finds that little attention has been paid to omissions, and where attention has been paid, it has been limited to viewing the omission as the mirror image of the act. Third, the article addresses as one element of a relevant concept of omission that the organization must be in a position to act, and, fourth, it establishes the basis of an obligation to act in some circumstances on the basis of the organization's mandate, thus introducing a version of what can be called 'role responsibility' into international law. © The Author(s), 2018.

998.html,Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals: The Threads of a Managerial Approach: A Rejoinder-fears and anxieties,"This rejoinder clarifies some aspects of my Foreword article, 'Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals: The Threads of a Managerial Approach', that may have been misconceived, such as the connection with the discourse of 'managerialism'. It also expands on the role that international adjudicators, states and litigants must play in preventing chaos as well as highlighting what is now a real challenge, namely the rise of political backlash. Ultimately, we should not forget that the fabric of international courts and tribunals is itself vulnerable. © The Author(s), 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EJIL Ltd.

999.html,Radical dissents in international criminal trials,"International criminal law, for much of its history, has been a law characterized by dissents. However, international law scholarship has largely ignored the role of the dissenting opinion in shaping the discourse of international criminal law. This article critically examines the nature and function of dissents at international criminal tribunals at a particularly crucial moment in the life of these courts, when the project of establishing accountability for mass atrocity through criminal trials is increasingly under attack. The article argues that the dissenting opinion is a crucial legal device that can have a transformative potential in international criminal adjudication through its creation of a civic space for contestation that paradoxically shores up the legitimacy of the international criminal trial. To this end, it constructs a discrete category of dissenting opinions at international criminal courts: 'radical dissents'. The content and rhetorical style of a radical dissent enables actors invested in the project of international criminal justice to use it as a vital dissentient voice both within and outside the courtroom. Agents who operate within the confines of the legal trial, such as defendants, lawyers, appellate chambers and future judges, may channel its authority to challenge the idiom in which the majority judgment speaks. Likewise, the radical dissent could provide a legal language through which academics, victims, civil society and other affected communities continue to grapple with constructing and coming to terms with events that defy human understanding. © The Author(s), 2018.
