Flexible Printed Active Antenna for Digital Television Reception,"© 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).This paper presents the development of a flexible printed active antenna for the digital television (DTV) reception in areas having poor signal or in high-rise buildings. The antenna structure is composed of a meander line printed on a polyimide film as a radiating element. It has a thickness of 0.3 mm, highly flexible, and very lightweight. The design and analysis of the radiating element are based on a full-wave method implemented by a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. The amplifier circuit consisting of a surface-mount transistor and passive components are integrated directly on the polyimide film, residing next to the feedline, to improve the antenna performance and minimize the whole antenna dimension. The impedance matching between the radiating element, the feed line, and the active circuit are considered. The measured results show that the return loss of more than approximately 10 dB, the maximum gain of about 18 dB, and the Omni-directional radiation pattern are achieved in the operating frequency band of 510-790 MHz. Due to its flexibility, low profile, lightweight, and additional gain, the proposed antenna could be useful for various specific applications.",Pratumsiri Teerapong; Janpugdee Panuwat,"author_location:,/author_department:/authors_name:author_name: ","ASJC: 2208, 2504; CPXCLASS: 402, 714.2, 716, 716.4, 723, 815.1.1; FLXCLASS: 902; SUBJABBR: ENGI, MATE","Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials",2208; 2504
Parametric study of hydrogen production via sorption enhanced steam methane reforming in a circulating fluidized bed riser,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdComputational fluid dynamics was applied for sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SESMR) operating in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser. The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2k full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H2 flux of 0.301 kg/m2 s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H2 purity and the H2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height.",Phuakpunk Kiattikhoon; Chalermsinsuwan Benjapon; Putivisutisak Sompong; Assabumrungrat Suttichai,"author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Center of Excellence in Catalysis and Catalytic Reaction Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Phuakpunk Kiattikhoon, author_name:Assabumrungrat Suttichai; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Fuels Research Center, Department of Chemical Technology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Chalermsinsuwan Benjapon; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Center of Excellence on Petrochemical and Materials Technology, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Chalermsinsuwan Benjapon; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Chalermsinsuwan Benjapon, author_name:Putivisutisak Sompong, author_name:Assabumrungrat Suttichai; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Putivisutisak Sompong","CPXCLASS: 522, 723.5, 802.2, 802.3, 803, 804, 804.1; ENCOMPASSCLASS: 306.5.1, 306.6.1, 307.3.1; FLXCLASS: 78.22; ASJC: 1600, 1500, 2209; SUBJABBR: CHEM, CENG, ENGI",Chemistry (all); Chemical Engineering (all); Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering,1600; 1500; 2209
Superhydrophobic coating from fluoroalkylsilane modified natural rubber encapsulated SiO 2 composites for self-driven oil/water separation,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic mesh was successfully prepared in a simple and environmentally friendly process by coating with fluoroalkylsilane-modified natural rubber-encapsulated silica latex (FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 ). TEM images confirmed the formation of a core-shell morphology, in which the rubber core was fully covered by a silica shell. This improved the thermal stability of the composites. Coating with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 enhanced both the hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the mesh. The depth profile of the XPS spectra revealed the presence of fluoroalkylsilane on the superhydrophobic mesh and Ar gas ion etching confirmed migration of the fluoroalkylsilane, SiO 2 and carbon to the mesh surface. SEM and AFM results quantified the surface roughness of the coated mesh. Meshes coated with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties. Surfaces coated with these encapsulated particles were successfully applied to oil/water separation. They exhibited a separation efficiency of up to 100% and were reusable across 30 cycles.",Saengkaew Jittraporn; Le Duy; Samart Chanatip; Sawada Hideo; Nishida Masakazu; Chanlek Narong; Kongparakul Suwadee; Kiatkamjornwong Suda,"author_location:Pathumthani,Thailand/author_department:Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Thammasat University/authors_name:author_name:Saengkaew Jittraporn, author_name:Le Duy, author_name:Samart Chanatip, author_name:Kongparakul Suwadee; author_location:Hirosaki,Japan/author_department:Department of Frontier Materials Chemistry, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University/authors_name:author_name:Sawada Hideo; author_location:Nagoya,Japan/author_department:National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)/authors_name:author_name:Nishida Masakazu; author_location:,Thailand/author_department:Synchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization)/authors_name:author_name:Chanlek Narong; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Kiatkamjornwong Suda; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:FRST, Academy of Science, Office of the Royal Society/authors_name:author_name:Kiatkamjornwong Suda","CPXCLASS: 641.1, 723.5, 802.3, 813.2, 818.1, 931.2; FLXCLASS: 902; ASJC: 1600, 3104, 3100, 3110, 2508; SUBJABBR: CHEM, PHYS, MATE","Chemistry (all); Condensed Matter Physics; Physics and Astronomy (all); Surfaces and Interfaces; Surfaces, Coatings and Films",1600; 3104; 3100; 3110; 2508
Electrochemical impedance-based DNA sensor using pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids for tuberculosis detection,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V. A label-free electrochemical DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-immobilized on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) was developed. Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R ct of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2–200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor.",Teengam Prinjaporn; Siangproh Weena; Tuantranont Adisorn; Vilaivan Tirayut; Chailapakul Orawon; Henry Charles S.,"author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Program in Petrochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Teengam Prinjaporn; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Srinakharinwirot University/authors_name:author_name:Siangproh Weena; author_location:,Thailand/author_department:Nanoelectronics and MEMS Laboratory, National Electronics and Computer Technology Center/authors_name:author_name:Tuantranont Adisorn; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Organic Synthesis Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Vilaivan Tirayut; author_location:Bangkok,Thailand/author_department:Electrochemistry and Optical Spectroscopy Center of Excellence, Department of Chemistry, Chulalongkorn University/authors_name:author_name:Chailapakul Orawon; author_location:Fort Collins,United States/author_department:Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University/authors_name:author_name:Henry Charles S.","EMCLASS: 4; ASJC: 1602, 1303, 2304, 1607; SUBJABBR: CHEM, BIOC, ENVI",Analytical Chemistry; Biochemistry; Environmental Chemistry; Spectroscopy,1602; 1303; 2304; 1607
